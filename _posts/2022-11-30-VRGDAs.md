# Motivation

One of the projects that I am auditing independently is using a heavily modified version of the (quite popular) VRGDA. This topic picked up quite some steam at the time of 0xMonaco and Art Gobblers, but I was busy with something else at that time and hence could not give this topic that attention it warranted.

Therefore, I am here to right the wrongs and study a bit about VRGDAs.

# What is GDAs ?

GDAs stand for Gradual Dutch Auction.
