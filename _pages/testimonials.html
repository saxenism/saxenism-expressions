                <p>Detailed report. It's really great to have a second set of eyes look through the code and to make sure all the bugs are patched. No one could have done it better than Rahul. Excellent writeup and a detailed review. It was precise and I learned a lot.</p>

                <p>You will come across only a few as diligent and "Ridiculously efficient" engineers as Rahul. I had the pleasure of working alongside Rahul as a blockchain engineer at Sublime. During the past year, I have watched him constantly strive to optimize and revamp our codebase, be it smart contracts or testing frameworks. His attention to detail has helped eliminate multiple vulnerabilities from our protocol. He has always been the go-to person for exploring new ideas and his Make-It-Happen attitude is a bonus. He is usually the first person to help out or collaborate with other team members. He will be a great value addition to any team he joins. </p>

                <p>One of the best audit experience we have been a part of. Rahul (and Parth) were great to work with. Their attention to details on contract design and adversarial thinking helped us along the audit process. The have delivered a well structured and comprehensive audit report.</p>
