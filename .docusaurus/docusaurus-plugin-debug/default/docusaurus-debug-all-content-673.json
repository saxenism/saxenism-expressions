          "content": "## Motivation\n\n> Note: You can also watch a phenomenal [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3im-iJdhv4&ab_channel=MarketplaceAPM) as an introduction to derivaties. This is recommended for people who already have a bit of understanding in this regard.\n\n**Derivative**: A financial contract, whose value depends on it's underlying assets. \n\nFor example, an apple pie is a derivative of an apple as it is **derived** from the apple and the price of the apple pie is determined by the quality and quantity of the apples used to make it (among other things).\n\nSimilarly, the price of a financial contract that is derived from some underlying assets such as shares of stock is determined by the quality,quantity and current price of the underlying asset and is known as a derivative.\n\nDerivative are of 4 types: \n+ Options\n+ Futures\n+ Swaps\n+ Forwards\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nAnd all the 4 types, especially futures and options, are closely linked. Therefore, if we even fully understand one instrument, we would be easily able to grasp all kinds of different derivative instruments.\n\nSince, we are interested in learning about *Perps* which is the pre-dominant derivative instrument used in web3, we'll take up learning about options and then transition into learning about **perps** or **perpetual futures**.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAll options contracts would have the following:\n+ Expiration Date\n    + Date after which the options contract is null and void\n+ Strike Price\n    + The agreed upon price for exercising the options contract\n+ Contract Multiplier (quantity of the underlying assets)\n    + You'll need $500 to buy an options contract with a price of $5.00 because options can be used to trade 100 shares of stock. So we need to multiply the price of option by 100 to get its actual value or premium\n\n## Call Options\n\n1. Call options prices move with the stock price, ie stock price increase, increases the price of the call option contract.\n2. This is because a call option can be used by the owner to buy 100 shares of stock at the call option's strike price.\n3. The potential upside of using a call option is limitless and the risk is limited, since my loss can be a maximum of the options premium (cost of buying the option contract).\n\n> The price of a call option contract is determined by how valuable is the ability to *buy* a particular share of stock (underlying asset) at the given *discounted* price (strike price) for a long enough duration into the future (expiration date, so that the open-market value of the underlying asset can *rise* even more).\n\n### Example\n\n+ Today a house is worth $200_000\n+ I want to buy this house, but instead I buy a call option contract to buy this house for $200_000 with an expiration of 2 years\n+ I paid a options premium of $10_000 to acquire the above contract\n+ Now there are two possibilities from here on:\n    + After 1.5 years, the value of the house lowers down to $150_000. \n        + In this case, my options contract is wasted, since if I want to buy the house, I will buy it from the open market for $150k, instead of using my contract to buy it for $200k. \n        + My loss in this case is of $10_000 (my options premium)\n    + After 1.5 years, the value of the house increases to $300_000.\n        + In this case, my options contract becomes very valuable as it allows it's owner to buy a property worth $300_000 for $200_000.\n        + Therefore, if I exercise my contract now, my profit would be ($ 300_000 - $200_000 - $10_000) $90_000.\n        + My profit in this case was $90_000. But theoretically, there is no limit to what my profit could have been depending on how much the price of the property moved up.\n+ Also, btw, the option contract multiplier in this case is 1.\n+ Call options provide you leverage. For example, an increase of 3% in the stock price could increase the price of the call options by 15%.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oWAiGTO.jpg)\n\n## Exercising Options\n\n+ When you trade options, you will almost NEVER exercise an option.\n+ However, an option's value comes from its ability to trade shares of stock at the strike price as opposed to the current stock price. \n+ Therefore, an option's price will **ALWAYS** include the benefit/profit that it can provide the owner if they were to exercise the option.\n+ So, in reality instead of making profit by exercising your call option, you will make the profit by simply selling the call option at the increased price.\n    + since the price of the option would **atleast** be equal to the benefit the owner would have if they decided to exercise the option.\n\n## Put Options\n\n1. Concepts are similar to Call options but inverted.\n2. Put option prices move inversely to the stock prices, ie, put options prices increases as the stock price falls, and vice versa\n3. This is because a put option contract allows the owner to *sell* 100 shares of stock at the put option's strike price. Therefore, this ability to sell stocks at a strike price becomes extremely valuable if the stock prices fall below the strike price and you can sell the shares for a price higher than the market price.\n4. Just as was the case for call options, you have leverage in put option too, where a fall on 6.1% in a stock price could result in an increase of 81% in the put contract price.\n\n> The price of a put option contract is determined by how valuable is the ability to *sell* a particular share of stock (underlying asset) at the given *inflated* price (strike price) for a long enough duration into the future (expiration date, so that the open-market value of the underlying asset can *fall* even more).\n\n### Pricing of PUT Options\n\n+ Incase of call options it was clear on how the pricing was done at the time of purchase. It was a minimum of (strikePrice - currentPrice) * noOfShares\n+ However, incase of a put option, the strike price is lower than the current price, so this formula clearly would not work to determine the price of a put option.\n+ For example a share could be trading at $130.71 currently and the put option to sell that share at the strike price of $130 would cost you $624 ($6.24 * 100). We need to figure out where this value of the put option contract is coming from.\n\n## Buying Puts vs Shorting Stocks\n\n### What is shorting?\n\n+ While buying put options contract, gives you the ownership of a **contract** that gives you the right to **sell** a particular share of stock at a pre-determined price.\n+ Short selling implies the literal *sale* of some shares of stock that the seller did not own in the first place and were borrowed from the lenders (usually brokers/market makers).\n+ The golden case in case of *short selling* is that once you borrow some shares, you sell them at the same time and at a later time, you buy back the shares at reduced price to return your debt and make the spread as your profit.\n+ It should now be clear that the potential downside risk in short selling is theoretically infinite as compared to the option premium in case of put option.\n\n### Put options > Short Selling (interms of user safety)\n+ Consider a case where NVDA shares are involved. \n    + If you shorted the stock at $280 and the stock went up to $320, then your loss would amount to $4000 ($40 * 100)\n    + On the other hand if you bought put option contract on the NVDA share with a strike price of $280, then no matter how high the price of NVDA soars, your potential loss would only be capped at a maximum of the option premium price.\n+ Therefore, buying puts of a stock is much safer than shorting the stock since in the case of shorting your downside risk is therotically infinite.\n\n# Intrinsic and Extrinsic Value\n\nThese are the components of options price. An options price is made up of only 2 things.\n    - Intrinsic Value\n    - Extrinsic Value\n    \n## Intrinsic Value\n\n+ **Intrinsic Value: ** For call options, the intrinsic value is extremely straightforward. The difference between the current market price of the underlying asset minus the lower price that I am allowed to sell it at due to my call option contract. \n+ Example: Consider the first scenario from the house example, where I bought a call option on the house for 2 years with a strike price of $200_000 and if after 1.5 years that cost of the house is at $300_000, then the **intrinsic value** of the contract is ($300_000 - $200_000) $100_000.\n+ Similarly, for put contracts, if you have a contract to be able to sell the underlying asset at $130 when the market value of the underlying asset has gone down to $120, then that means that the put option contract at that point of time has an intrinsic value of $10 (into the contract multiplier number).\n\n\n## Extrinsic Value\n\n+ **Extrinsic Value: ** Actual cost of the options contract - intrinsic value. Yayy!! I am genius :)\n+ This value is also sometimes referred to as the *time value* since it takes into account, the **potential** for the option to become **more valuable** (intrinsically valuable) before it reaches expiration.\n+ Let's consider an example of TSLA stock to better understand the concept of different types of values.\n    + TSLA Stock Price: $836.41\n    + June 800 Call Price: $94.10\n    + Intrinsic Value: $36.41 ($836.41 Stock Price - $800 Call Strike price)\n    + Extrinsic/Time Value: $57.69 ($94.10 Options Price - $36.41 Intrinsic Value)\n    + Time to Expiration: 38 Days\n    + The current *real* value of this option is $36.41 because it can be used to buy shares $36.41 below the stock price.\n    + But could that increase in the next 38 days? **Absolutely**.\n\n+ Therefore, even if we see two options with the exact same strike prices, but with different expiration dates, the one with the farther expiration date will be trading for a much higher premium than the one with the closer expiration date.\n+ Therefore, even for contracts with 0 intrinsic value currently, there can be significant total value due to the time left and potential for it to gain intrinsic value in that timeframe.\n\n### Extrinsic Value Time Decay\n\n+ Now that we understand how the time remaining into the expiration of an options contract determines it's extrinsic value and hence it's overall value. \n+ It will be quite clear to you now that if you buy a call options contract with lots of time left to expire and if the price do not move until the end of the contract's expiration date, you'll lose money even if the stock's value did not exactly go *against* of what you were betting.\n\n## Important terms to understand\n\n### 1. In-The-Money (ITM Options)\n\nAny option that has intrinsic value.\n\n### 2. Out-of-the-money (OTM Options)\n\nAny option without intrinsic value.\n\n### 3. At-the-money (ATM Options)\n\nAny option with a strike price very close to the current stock price.\n\n# Shorting Call Options\n\nWe don't always have to buy an option and we can actually bet against an options price.\n\n+ We can bet against an options price and we make money when the options price decreases. This is called shorting options.\n+ The below figure represents what it means to short stuff (a stock for example)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HS2z8cO.png)\n\n> You sell *x* amount of stock first at a given price (by borrowing those stocks from someone else) and after a few days when the market price of the stock decrease, you buy *x* amount of those stock from the market at the discounted price and return the share to your lender. Your profit is the difference between the amount you receieved when *selling* the initial *x* shares and the amount spent when you purchased back the *x* amount of stocks.\n\n+ Therefore, here you will *sell* an option (that you do not own) as an opening trade and your goal is to buy it back (preferably at a lower price) in the future to pay back your debt.\n+ So, you can also make money with this strategy not only when the price drops but also when the price remains stagnant for a long time (extrinsic value time delay)\n+ This is however an **incredibly risky strategy**, since if you short the price of a call option, and if the price of underlying stock increases, there is **no limit** to how much you can lose given that *options are leveraged* in the first place.\n\n> Realisitcally speaking, since this strategy is so risky and volatile, you need to have a margin account set aside to undertake these kind of trades. This account basically maitains your cash balance as collateral to undertake these trades.\n\n> And a margin call would be basically the market event where, the conditions are stacked so significantly against you that your lender deems you incapable of paying back their loan, so they take the relevant amount from your margin account.\n\n+ Here's an image for an example where a trader shorts NETFLIX call options and incurs massive loss:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zG94Kjt.jpg)\n\n+ What's interesting is that you can make money even if at the time of contract expiration, the stock price is higher than the strike price.\n+ This is because, for you the break-even price is the sum of the `strike price` + `what you sold the contract for`. So, if the options price goes beyond the sum of these two, only then would you start incurring losses.\n+ \n![](https://i.imgur.com/bPyeC0l.jpg)\n\n# Shorting Put Options\n\n+ Selling put options that you do not own (borrowed put options) as an opening trade and hoping to buy it back in the future for lesser amount of money.\n+ Since, you are hoping for the put options price to decrease, you essentially want the underlying stock to rise in prices (which decreases the intrinsic value of the put options) and therefore this is a **BULLISH STRATEGY**.\n+ Here is an example from ACTIVISION showing the same\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UqkCaoH.jpg)\n\n\n**WITH THIS, WE HAVE LEARNED THE 4 BASIC OPTIONS TRADE THAT MAKE UP ALL OPTIONS STRATEGIES**\n\n### Summary\n\nBuying Call Options => Bullish\nBuying Put Options => Bearish\nShorting Call Options => Bearish\nShorting Put Options => Bullish\n\n# Implied Volatility\n\n+ Related to option pricing.\n    + What implies the volatility? Option Prices. More specifically, the extrinsic value in the options relative to the time until they expire.\n+ We have taken the first step to understand options pricing by understanding intrinsic and extrinsic values, now we need to look at implied volatility.\n+ Two ATM options contracts with similar current stock prices, same strike price and same expiration date and can drastically different pricing of the options.\n+ Here's an example:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iPxlJst.jpg)\n\n+ This difference can be explained via implied volatility. The Teledoc options are trading with a higher implied volatility than Visa options. The markets expects much more price fluctuations in the Teladoc stock compared to the Visa stock.\n+ But, why would the market thing that Teladoc share will have more price fluctuations (and therefore a larger profit potential with its call options) compared to Visa stocks?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g2v4FzU.jpg)\n\n> The observed stock price changes over the last couple of months indicate that the Teladoc shares are atleast twice as volatile as the Visa shares.\n\n+ When buying options you can make money from an increase in implied volatility, which literally means the option prices are increasing broadly (more extrinsic value in all options)\n    + Suppose a good news about Visa came out late at night, the stock prices wouldn't change but the price of the call options would start shooting up relative to the time left for expiration as people start agressively buying the VISA call options since they are expecting a bigger volatility in the VISA stocks now.\n    + Similary if a bad news would have come out, you would have list money.\n+ When the implied volatility in a stock price is incredibly high, it is a good time to short those expensive options, as you can make money when the implied volatility of stock decreases over a few days. And you can do so without any change in the stock price.\n    + However, one thing to keep in mind is that changes in options prices drive changes in implied volatility and not the other way around.\n\n# Exercising and Assignment\n\n+ 99% of the time you would not exercise your options, however if you do decide to exercise your option, say, a *put option*, a trader who had shorted a put option similar to your position will be *assigned* and they'll have to **buy** your shares at the strike price.\n+ Any option with $0.01 or more of intrinsic value will be automatically exercised if held through expiration.\n+ The reason you wouldn't want to exercise an option is that any extrinsic value that exists in an option will be lost when exercising it.\n+ You should only consider trading options in markets that have deep options liqudity, ie, a shit ton of option trading activity is happening in that market everyday, because otherwise it will be like buying concert tickets to a band nobody wants to see. **What happens if you need to sell your tickets?** \n\n# Difference between Futures & Options Contract\n\n## Similarity:\n\n+ Both are derivatie contract of an asset.\n+ An agreement between the buyer and seller at a predefined price and for a predefined time\n\n## Difference\n\n+ *Obligation: * Buyers are obliged to execute the contract in case of futures.\n+ *Advance Payment: * No advance payment required in case of futures, but in case of options, premiums are paid.\n+ *Risk: * In case of futures, the risk is high since there is unlimited profit or loss that can be made however options are comparatively safer since the downside is capped (you loose your premium) and the upside is uncapped.\n\nChainlink\nOPStack\nOptimism\nHubble"

          "content": "My last blog post about [Bit Magic](https://saxenism.com/web3/solidity/language-tricks/bit-magic/intermediate/2022/09/06/Bit-Magic-Solidity.html) generated some buzz amongst fellow EVM developers and some of them reached out to me to include additional things in my blog related to using bits effectively in Solidity and the EVM in general.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nOne such dev was the giga-chad maintainer of ERC721A himself, [Vectorized.eth](https://twitter.com/optimizoor) and he shared [a tweet](https://twitter.com/optimizoor/status/1526015118479200256) with me where he showed a few code snippets where some really cool things were going on.\n\nUnfortunately, I could not make much sense out of it from the snippets and I had to head over to the [ERC721A pull request](https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A/pull/272) that was behind the tweet and at that time my world turned upside down.\n\nThe [Chiru Labs](https://github.com/chiru-labs) team had written some incredible code and while I have not (yet) figured everything happening in the contract, I did understand that the essence of the contract/PR was to use *uint packing* instead of *structs*.\n\nSo, I set out to write some code for myself and figure out how struct can be packed into uints and see if that could lead to any gas savings. So, let me present my finding.\n\n**Spoiler Alert** <br/>\nYes, it was possible. <br/>\nYes, it did save gas. <br/>\nYes, I did love it. <br/>\n\n# Pitfalls\n\nFirst of all, to proceed ahead with this article, you need to know what the *left shift operator* is, what the *right shift operator* and what is it that they do. Apart from that, you should also understand bitwise operations such as `&` , `|`, `~` ,etc.\n\nA good place to learn these concepts or revisit them is [this gfg blog](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-operators-in-c-cpp/).\n\nNext is the biggest pitfall of all. This is where I tripped hard and my mind almost broke (since I could not make sense of the ERC721A contract). Since, most of us might have native languages where we read that language from left to right you would naturally expect Solidity to also have the first stored data on the leftmost end and last saved data on the rightmost end. \n\n*BUT BUT BUT*\n\nThat is not the case. Basically, if you were to store four numbers A,B,C and D in that order, inside of a word you would expect that word to look like this: [A,B,C,D] but they would be stored as [D,C,B,A]. \n\n(Slightly relevant: ) A good primer about Endianess can be found in [this freecodecamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-endianness-big-endian-vs-little-endian/).\n\nLet me illustrate this point with [a picture](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZvGzhf9o6j837xF7eYLnufEACDa2MEvG8qh9TRz3k7bv):\n\n![Big/Little Endian Explanation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/194752317-bfb99eeb-f452-4991-99ff-df6c6b9ba102.jpeg)\n\n# Onto the code\n\nNow that we have established our motivation, our objectives and are aware of the common pitfalls, time to relish the sweet code that we all had been waiting for.\n\nThe code is pretty self-explainatory and comments are put where needed. No more explanation is required.\n\nAlso, the Harry Potter theme of this contract was inspired by a [silly tweet](https://twitter.com/longestwavelen/status/1578620950479659008?s=20&t=u42okhhEbNKXrWgyorA8NA).

          "content": "## Function Types\n\nFor official documentations follow this [link](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/types.html#function-types).\n\nSo, in Solidity, you can pass functions themselves as parameters to other functions. These type of parameters are called function types.\n\nThese function types can be used to pass and return functions from function calls.\n\n## Example\n\n### 1. Format of function types is the following:\n\n```solidity\nfunction (<parameter types>) {internal | external} [pure | view | payable] [returns(<return types>)]\n```\n\n> Note : Function types can only be internal or external. Also, the `return types` cannot be empty if the function in question does not return anything, in this case, completely omit the `returns` keyword.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n### 2. Conversions\n\nfunction `A` can be converted to function `B` if they identical parameter types, identical return types, identical internal/external propery, and state mutability of `A` is more restrictive than `B`.\n\nSince `view` says that no state will be changed whereas `pure` says no state variable will be changed or read. Therefore, `pure` is more restrictive than `view`\n\nAlso, rememeber that all `non-payable` functions are `payable` (accepting 0 Ether), but no non-payable is payable. Therefore `non-payable` is more restrictive. \n\nSo,\n#### 2.1 `pure` can be converted to `view` and `non-payable`\n#### 2.2 `view` can be converted to `non-payable`\n#### 2.3 `non-payable` can be converted to `payable`\n\n### 3. A short mock implementation of this concept\n\n```solidity\n\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.11;\n\ncontract FunctionParameter {\n\n    uint256 public currentSupply = 100;\n\n    function increaseSupply(uint256 _newSupply) public returns(uint256) {\n        uint256 _currentSupply = currentSupply;\n        _changeSupply(_currentSupply, _newSupply, _add);\n        return currentSupply;\n    }\n\n    function decreaseSupply(uint256 _decreaseSupplyBy) public returns(uint256) {\n        uint256 _currentSupply = currentSupply;\n        _changeSupply(_currentSupply, _decreaseSupplyBy, _sub);\n        return currentSupply;\n    }\n\n    function fundMe() external payable{}\n\n////////////////////////\n// Internal functions\n////////////////////////\n\n    function _changeSupply(uint256 a, uint256 b, function(uint256, uint256) internal pure returns(uint256) foo) internal returns(uint256) {\n        currentSupply = foo(a, b);\n        return currentSupply;\n    }\n    \n    function _add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\n        return (a + b);\n    }\n\n    function _sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns(uint256) {\n        return (a > b ? (a - b) : 0 );\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nSimilarly as this was done for `internal` function calls, you can use this concept for `external` function calls. \n\n> Note: One obvious but important thing to note here is that the internal functions can only be called inside the current contract (including library functions and inherited functions) because they cannot be executed outside of the context of the current contract."

          "content": "## Bitwise Operations\n\nIncludes all basic bitwise operations such as `and`, `or`, `xor`, `not`, `shiftLeft`, `shiftRight` etc.\n\n```solidity\n\nuint x;\nuint y;\n\nx & y // and\nx | y // or\nx ^ y // xor\n~x    // not\nx << y // shift x by y bits to the left\nx >> y // shift x by y bits to the right\n\n```\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n## Get Last N bits\n\nBinary representation of (x-1) can be obtained by simply flipping all the bits to the right of the rightmost 1 in x and also including the rightmost 1.\n\nExample (Confirm using [this website](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html) if you want)\n\n7 = 0111\n\n6 = 0110\n\n---\n\n70 = 1000110\n\n69 = 1000101\n\n---\n\n420 = 110100100\n\n419 = 110100011\n\n\n----\n\nSo, now if you created a number of N bits with all 1's, and did an & with the number x in question, you will get the value of the last N bits.\n\n```solidity \n\nfunction getLastNBits(uint x, uint n) external pure returns(uint256) {\n    uint mask = (1 << n) - 1;\n    return x & mask;\n}\n\n/****\n// In general, a modulo can be easily converted into a bitwise & if the divisor is power of 2 ((1 << anything) would always be a power of 2).\n// All you gotta do is to translate that modulo into a bitwise & of `divisor - 1`.\n// By reverse-engineering this piece of information, we can write another function called getLastNBitsUsingMod\n\n// In terms of gas consumption:\n// getLastNBits(22313) == getLastNBitsUsingMod(22309)\n*****/\n\nfunction getLastNBitsUsingMod(uint x, uint N) pure external returns (uint result) {\n        result = x % (1 << N);\n}\n```\n\n\n\n    \n\n## Most significant bit position\n\nKeep on right-shifting the number until it all becomes 0. Count the number of times, you had to do this operations. That's all.\n\n```solidity\n\nfunction mostSignificantBit(uint256 x) public pure returns(uint256) {\n    uint i;\n    while((x >>= 1) > 0) { \n        ++i;\n    }\n    return i;\n}\n\n```\n\n### NOTE\nAs pointed out by [devtooligan](https://twitter.com/devtooligan), the above approach would return 1 for both x = 0 and x = 1, which is somewhat of a problem. So, a safer implementation as suggested by him is:\n\n```solidity\n\nfunction mostSignificantBit(uint256 x) public pure returns(uint256) {\n    uint i;\n    while(x > 0) { \n        ++i;\n        x >>= 1;\n    }\n    return i;\n}\n\n```\n\nBtw this implementation would also change the answer from 0-indexed to 1-indexed.\n\nCheers.\n\n## Get first N bits\n\nSame concept as the function `getLastNBits` we discussed above.\n\nThe only change here would be in the mask where we shift n number of 1's to the beginning of the mask and keep the rest as 0's.\n\nAnother tip would be, if length is not available, then use the function `mostSignificantBit` we discussed before.\n\n```solidity\n\nfunction getFirstNBits(uint x, uint n, uint len) public pure returns(uint256) {\n    uint mask = ((1 << n) - 1) << (len - n);\n    return x & mask;\n}\n\n```\n\n## Is Power of 2\n\nIf x is a power of 2, then x will have only 1 set bit, rest all will be 0's. And then for (x-1) all bits will be set apart from the earlier leading 1. Therefore, if x would be a power of 2, then x&(x-1) will always give 0 as the result.\n\n```solidity\n\nfunction isPowerOfTwo(uint x) external pure returns(bool) {\n        return (x == 0 || x & (x-1) == 0);\n    }\n\n```\n\n## Count number of set bits\n\nAs explained in the previous algorithm, the relationship between the bits of x and x-1. So as in x-1, the rightmost 1 and bits right to it are flipped, then by performing x&(x-1), and storing it in x, will reduce x to a number containing number of ones(in its binary form) less than the previous state of x, thus increasing the value of count in each iteration.\n\n```solidity\n\nfunction countSetBits(uint x) public pure returns(uint) {\n    uint count;\n    while (x != 0) {\n        x = x & (x-1);\n        ++count;\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\n```\n\n## Pack a number of bools into a single slot (inside uint256)\n\nAs you may know the most expensive operation in Ethereum is storing data (SSTORE). So you should always look for ways to reduce the storage requirements.\n\nDon't need to explain much.

          "content": "Let us see today when and why do we use `abi.encode` vs `abi.encodePacked`.\n\n## What is a hash function?\n\nA hash function has the following characterisitics:\n\n+ A function that takes in arbitrary size input and outputs a data of fixed size\n+ Properties:\n    + Deterministic\n        + hash(x) = h, every time without fail\n    + quick to compute the hash\n    + irreversible\n        + given h, (really)hard to find x such that hash(x) = h\n    + small change in input changes the output significantly\n        + hard to find x, y such that hash(x) = hash(y)\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n## String Encoding\n\nThe solidity built-in function `abi.encode` enables to encode any Solidity types into raw bytes, that can be interpreted directly by the EVM.\n\nNote that multiple arguments can be given to this function.\n\nSo, if we do something like:\n`abi.encode(\"Solidity\");`\n\nWe get the result in the following format:\n\n+ 1st (32 bytes) word = offset → indicates at which bytes index the string starts. Here 0x20 (in hex) = 32 (in decimals). If you count 32 from the beginning (= index 32), you will reach the starting point of where the actual encoded string starts.\n\n+ 2nd (32 bytes) word = string length → in the case of the string, this indicates how many characters (including whitespaces) are included in the string. So simply the “string.length “\n\n+ 3rd (32 bytes) word = the actual utf8 encoded string → each individual bytes corresponds to hex notation of a letter / character encoded in utf8. If you search each individual bytes from 536f6c6964697479 inside an utf8 table, you will be able to decode the string. For instance, 53 corresponds to uppercase S , 6f corresponds to lowercase o , 6c corresponds to lowercase l , etc…\n\nThe actual encoded bytes would look something like this:\n\n```\n{\n\t\"0\": \"bytes: 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008536f6c6964697479000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n}\n```\n\nThe contract code was as straightforward as it gets:\n\n```\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\n\npragma solidity 0.8.7;\n\ncontract StringEncoding {\n    bytes public encodedString = abi.encode(\"Solidity\");\n}\n```\n\n## Few other ABI Encodings\n\n+ address payable -> address\n+ contract -> address\n+ enum -> uint8\n+ struct -> tuple of elementry types\n\n## Few points on abi.encode, abi.encodePacked, abi.encodeWithSelector, abi.encodeWithSignature\n\n+ When using `abi.encode`, all elementary types are padded to 32 bytes and dynamic arrays include their length.\n    + Therefore, it is also possible to decode the resulting hash using `abi.decode` if the data type is known.\n    + This encoding is done using the ABI specs.\n+ When using `abi.encodePacked` only the minimum possible memory is utilised. \n    + Therefore, if you were hashing an address with this function, it will only take up 20 bytes and the rest of the word remains unpadded.\n    + For dynamic types, the offset and the length is not stored. \n    ```\n    abi.encodePacked(\"Solidity\");\n    // returns -> 0x536f6c6964697479\n    ```\n\n+ Since `abi.encodePacked` is non-standard hashing and uses the least amount of memory, it is usually gas-efficient\n\n+ If you are making calls to an (external) contract, you'll more likely be using `abi.encode` (because it uses the ABI specs) and when you simply want to save some space and *not* call a contract, you'll be using `abi.encodePacked`.\n\n+ If you are dealing with more than one dynamic data types, use `abi.encode` as it prevents collision.\n\n+ Whereas, in multiple dynamic data types there is a good chance of collision happening if used with `abi.encodePacked`\n\n+ `abi.encodeWithSignature` is the same as `abi.encode` but the function selector is used as the first parameter. Use when the signature is known and don't want to calculate the selector.\n\n+ `abi.encodeWithSelector`, almost same as `abi.encodeWithSignature` but first param is selector.\n\nCode Examples of the above encode options:\n\n```solidity\n\n// Case 1\n(success, ) = address(c).call(abi.encodeWithSignature(\"myfunction(uint256,uint256)\", 400,500));\n\n// Case 2\n(success, ) = address(c).call(abi.encodeWithSelector(bytes4(keccak256(\"myfunction(uint256,uint256)\")), 400,500));\n\n// Case 3\ncontract_instance.myfunction(400,500);\n\n```\n\n+ Case 3 is more expensive but safer than the other cases.\n> This is because, the EVM considers a call to a non-existing contract to always succeed. Therefore, Solidity includes an extra check using the `extcodesize` opcode when performing external calls.\nThis ensures that the contract that is about to be called either actually exists (contains code) or an exception is raised.\n\n> Low level calls (which operate on address rather than a contract instance) ignore this check and therefore become gas efficient but less safe. Eg. `call`, `transfer`, `delegatecall`, `staticcall`, `send`.\n\n+ A very important point to note is:\nIf a function exists such that:\n```\nfunction foo(uint256 _a, address _b) {\n    // do something\n}\n```\n\nThen, the function selector for this particular function would be:\n\n```\nbytes4(keccak256(bytes('foo(uint256,address)'))); // This is correct\n\nbytes4(keccak256(bytes('foo(uint256, address)'))); // This would be incorrect, because of the space between the two param types\n\nbytes4(keccak256(bytes('foo(uint,address)'))); // Again incorrect, because we cannot use the alias of uint, we have to use the entire uint256\n```\n\n+ A more comprehensive example from *solidity-by-example*\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\n\ncontract Receiver {\n    event Received(address caller, uint amount, string message);\n\n    fallback() external payable {\n        emit Received(msg.sender, msg.value, \"Fallback was called\");\n    }\n\n    function foo(string memory _message, uint _x) public payable returns (uint) {\n        emit Received(msg.sender, msg.value, _message);\n\n        return _x + 1;\n    }\n}\n\ncontract Caller {\n    event Response(bool success, bytes data);\n\n    // Let's imagine that contract B does not have the source code for\n    // contract A, but we do know the address of A and the function to call.\n    function testCallFoo(address payable _addr) public payable {\n        // You can send ether and specify a custom gas amount\n        (bool success, bytes memory data) = _addr.call{value: msg.value, gas: 5000}(\n            abi.encodeWithSignature(\"foo(string,uint256)\", \"call foo\", 123)\n        );\n\n        emit Response(success, data);\n    }\n\n    // Calling a function that does not exist triggers the fallback function.\n    function testCallDoesNotExist(address _addr) public {\n        (bool success, bytes memory data) = _addr.call(\n            abi.encodeWithSignature(\"doesNotExist()\")\n        );\n\n        emit Response(success, data);\n    }\n}\n\n```"

          "content": "Jet:  \n> Yul is part of a greater family of EVM assembly languages\n>\n> its basically EVM assembly wrapped into a language with some Ssyntactic sugar\n>\n> What's great about that is that the only thing you need to write Yul is an understanding of the EVM. Looking at Yul contracts won't really get you to that point\n\nSo, let's get a bit of a deeper understanding of the EVM\n\n## What is an EVM\n\nConsider Ethereum to be a global computer (with each node having its own permanent data store) and EVM is the processor. It basically handles smart contract deployment and execution. It is just a computation engine, and as such provides an abstraction of just computation and storage, similar to Java Virtual Machine(JVM).\n\nThe EVM executes its own bytecode intstruction set which higher level smart contract languages such as LLL, Serpent, Mutan or Solidity are compiled into. The EVM does not require to have any scheduling capability because Ethereum clients run through verified block transactions to determine which smart contract needs executing and in which order. This mechanism makes **EVM a single-threaded mechanism**.\n\n1. A Turing machine is a finite (there are a limited number of states, such as a coin toss will have only two states: HEADS or TAILS) state machine that has an unlimited supply of paper tape that it can write on and read back.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n2. The EVM is a quasi-Turing complete state machine. \n\n  * *Quasi* because all execution processes are limited to a finite number of computational steps by the amount of gas available for any given smart        contract execution.\n\n3. This property: the requirement of a particular amount of gas to execute transactions on the EVM (absence of which leads to halting of execution) helps us do away with the **Halting Problem**\n\n> **Note** What is the halting problem?\n>\n>  Halting means that the program on certain input will accept it and halt or reject it and halt, but it would never go into an infinite loop. So essentially halting == terminating.\n\n4. The EVM has a stack-based architecture, storing all in-memory values on a stack. It works with a word size of 256 bits\n\n5. EVM has a few addressable data components such as:\n  - An immutable program code ROM (opcodes)\n  - A volatile memory (memory variables probably includes calldata)\n  - A permanent storage (keyword: storage)\n\n## The EVM Instruction Set (Bytecode operations)\n\nIn addition to the typical bytecode operations (arithmetical, logical, memory access, flow control, logging etc), the EVM also has access to account information (address and balance) & block information (current gas price, block number etc)\n\n1. Arithmetic Operations\n\n```\nADD        //Add the top two stack items\nMUL        //Multiply the top two stack items\nSUB        //Subtract the top two stack items\nDIV        //Integer division\nSDIV       //Signed integer division\nMOD        //Modulo (remainder) operation\nSMOD       //Signed modulo operation\nADDMOD     //Addition modulo any number\nMULMOD     //Multiplication modulo any number\nEXP        //Exponential operation\nSIGNEXTEND //Extend the length of a two's complement signed integer\nSHA3       //Compute the Keccak-256 hash of a block of memory\n\n```\n\n> **Note** All arithmetic is performed modulo 2<sup>256</sup> (unless otherwise noted), and the also 0<sup>0</sup> is taken to be 1.\n\n\n2. Stack Operations\n\n```\nPOP     //Remove the top item from the stack\nMLOAD   //Load a word from memory\nMSTORE  //Save a word to memory\nMSTORE8 //Save a byte to memory\nSLOAD   //Load a word from storage\nSSTORE  //Save a word to storage\nMSIZE   //Get the size of the active memory in bytes\nPUSHx   //Place x byte item on the stack, where x can be any integer from\n        // 1 to 32 (full word) inclusive\nDUPx    //Duplicate the x-th stack item, where x can be any integer from\n        // 1 to 16 inclusive\nSWAPx   //Exchange 1st and (x+1)-th stack items, where x can be any\n        // integer from 1 to 16 inclusive\n\n```\n\n3. Process Flow Operations\n\n```\nSTOP      //Halt execution\nJUMP      //Set the program counter to any value\nJUMPI     //Conditionally alter the program counter\nPC        //Get the value of the program counter (prior to the increment corresponding to this instruction)\nJUMPDEST  //Mark a valid destination for jumps\n```\n\n4.

Therefore, Ethereum can be considered a **transaction-based state machine** since external actors (ie account holders and miners) initiate state transitions by creating, accepting and ordering transactions.\n\nAt the top level, we have the Ethereum world state. The world state is a mapping of Ethereum addresses (160-bit values) to accounts. At the lower level, each Ethereum address represents an account comprising an Ether balance, a nonce (reps the number of txn successfully if EOA or the number of contracts created, if a contract), the account's storage, and account's code. An EOA will always have no code and an empty storage.\n\nFor a transaction resulting in a smart contract code execution, you can think of the EVM running on a sandboxed copy of the Ethereum world state, with this sandboxed version being discarded completely if execution cannot complete for whatever reason (Eg OOG exception). However if the execution does complete successfully, then the real-world state is updated to match the sandboxed version, including any changes to the called contract's storage data, any new contracts created, and any ether balance transfers that were initiated.\n\n> **Note** Gas is deducted even in cases of failed execution, because as the code exection progresses, the gas gas supply is reduced according to the gas cost of the operations executed. If at any point the gas supply is reduced to zero we get an \"Out of Gas\" (OOG) exception; execution immediately halts and the transaction is abandoned. No changes to the Ethereum state are applied, except for the sender’s nonce being incremented and their ether balance going down to pay the block’s beneficiary for the resources used to execute the code upto the halting point.\n\nA contract can call other contracts, with each call resulting in another EVM being instantiated around the new target of the call. Each instantiation has its sandbox world state initialized from the sandbox of the EVM at the level above.\n\n## Compiling Solidity to EVM Bytecode\n\nThis section basically explains how the opcodes are arranged in stack and how they operate. Things like DUP1, PUSH1, JUMPI, EQ, LT, MLOAD etc are used to demonstrate how a program is executed in the EVM.\n\n> **Note** There is an important but subtle difference between the code used when creating and deploying a new contract on the Ethereum platform and the code of the contract itself. In order to create a new contract, a special transaction is needed that has its to field set to the special 0x0 address and its data field set to the contract’s initiation code. When such a contract creation transaction is processed, the code for the new contract account is not the code in the data field of the transaction. Instead, an EVM is instantiated with the code in the data field of the transaction loaded into its program code ROM, and then the output of the execution of that deployment code is taken as the code for the new contract account. This is so that new contracts can be programmatically initialized using the Ethereum world state at the time of deployment, setting values in the contract’s storage and even sending ether or creating further new contracts.\n\nTo get examples on this, [the ethereum mastery book](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/13evm.asciidoc#contract-deployment-code) is good.\n\nAnd an awesome resource to pick up how EVM opcode works is [this presentation from Ethereum Engineering Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxL_1AfV7N4&ab_channel=EthereumEngineeringGroup)\n\nPS: I made some notes from this YT talk. You can see them [here](https://github.com/saxenism/EVM-Varta/blob/master/Resources/YulYoga-EVMNotes.pdf)\n\n## Turing Completeness and Gas\n\nWe have already discussed how the Ethereum Virtual Machine is a quasi-Turing-complete machine since it solves the halting problem.\n\nOne more interesting point to note is what happens when a (apparently rich af) attacker supposedly offers infinite gas and asks the EVM to do infinite computations? Well, if after a prespecified maximum amount of computation has been performed, the execution hasn’t ended, the execution of the program is halted by the EVM. That limit isn’t fixed in Ethereum—you can pay to increase it up to a maximum (called the \"block gas limit\"), and everyone can agree to increase that maximum over time. Nevertheless, at any one time, there is a limit in place, and transactions that consume too much gas while executing are halted.\n\n## Gas\n\nGas is the cost to for on-chain computation and storage.\n\nEach operation performed by a transaction or contract costs a fixed amount of gas. Example:\n1. Addition costs 3 gas\n2. Keccak-256 costs 30 gas + 6 gas for each 256 bits of data being hashed\n3. Sending a transaction costs 21,000 gas\n\nGas serves two purposes:\n1. Prevents DoS attacks, first by making it financially infeasible and then asking the tx.origin to set a limit to the gas they are willing to pay.\n2. Providing reward to miners (as a hedge against volatile ETH prices)\n\n## Gas Accounting During Execution\n\nIn the first instance, the EVM is provided with the gas supply equal to the amount specified by the gas limit, and all steps that can be performed with that amount of gas, are performed.\n\nIf all the steps were performed, any remaining gas is sent to the sender in form of Ether\n\n```\nrefunded ether = remaining gas * gas price\n```\n\nAnd in either case, the miner gets paid (in ether) because the computations were done in both cases\n\n```\nminer fee = gas cost * gas price\n```\n\n## Gas Accounting Considerations\n\nThe objective is matching gas cost of transactions to the real-world cost of resources.\n\n## Gas Cost vs Gas Price\n\n- Gas cost is the number of units of gas required to perform a particular operation.\n\n- Gas price is the amount of ether you are willing to pay per unit of gas when you send your transaction to the Ethereum network.\n\n## Negative Gas Costs (Refund)\n\n- Deleting a contract (SELFDESTRUCT) is worth a refund of 24,000 gas.\n\n- Changing a storage address from a nonzero value to zero (SSTORE[x] = 0) is worth a refund of 15,000 gas.\n\n## Block Gas Limit\n\nThe block gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that may be consumed by all the transactions in a block, and constrains how many transactions can fit into a block.\n\nThe block gas limit on the Ethereum mainnet is 8 million gas at the time of writing according to https://etherscan.io, meaning that around 380 basic transactions (each consuming 21,000 gas) could fit into a block.\n\n## Decisions regarding block gas limit\n\nThe miners on the network collectively decide the block gas limit. Individuals who want to mine on the Ethereum network use a mining program, such as Ethminer, which connects to a Geth or Parity Ethereum client. The Ethereum protocol has a built-in mechanism where miners can vote on the gas limit so capacity can be increased or decreased in subsequent blocks. The miner of a block can vote to adjust the block gas limit by a factor of 1/1,024 (0.0976%) in either direction. The result of this is an adjustable block size based on the needs of the network at the time. This mechanism is coupled with a default mining strategy where miners vote on a gas limit that is at least 4.7 million gas, but which targets a value of 150% of the average of recent total gas usage per block (using a 1,024-block exponential moving average).\n\n`\nEnd of Ethereuem Book\n`\n\n## Femboy Capital (Definitely not as detailed as the Ethereum book)\n\n> Will only include small piece of information from this source which add more clarity to already discussed topics or something that might have been missing above.\n\n+ The EVM keeps track of the specific section of the bytecode it is currently executing with a pointer called the **Program Counter** (PC)\n+ A VM execution loop looks something like this:\n   + Fetch the instruction the PC points to\n   + Execute the instruction\n   + If the instruction jumps, set the PC to the new target\n   + Otherwise, increment the PC\n+ The stack can accomodate a maximum of 1024 elements and each element (word) being 256 bits long\n+ This is a good image to visualize memory and storage inside of Ethereum\n\n![Screenshot from 2022-05-28 15-00-08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/170819622-d6ed38fe-b9d5-4398-9b38-84e1dd82b209.png)\n\n+ And this image is a good way to visualize how programs are executed in the EVM:\n \n![Screenshot from 2022-05-28 15-04-09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/170819737-918ac257-50fe-44f7-9355-d1d430fca27b.png)\n\n+ Storage in the EVM operates as a map of 32 byte keys to 32 byte values. It is persistent, meaning that the current storage state sticks around even after contract exectuion completes (STOP or RETURN is called). Any subsequent runs of a contract will have read and write access to the same storage space. There is no opportunity for data races because the EVM does not currently support concurrent execution of a single contract - all transactions are executed sequentially.\n\n+ SSTORE cost a whopping 22100 gas! SLOAD cost 100. Reading and writing to storage is very expensive.\n\n## Uncategorised / Scratch Space\n\n### Transactions\n\n1. A transaction is a message that is sent from one account to another account.\n\nThat account can be the sender itself or it could be an empty field too.\n\nThe transaction can include binary data (called *payload*) and Ether.\n\n2. If the target contains code, then that code is executed with the payload being used as the input.\n\n3. If the target account is not set, the transaction creates a *new contract*. The address of the new contract is derived from the *address of the deployer* + *their nonce(number of transactions done by deployer)*.\n\n4. The output data of this execution is permanently stored as the code of the contract.\n\n4. The payload of such a contract creation is taken to be the EVM bytecode and executed. This means that in order to create a contract, we do not send the code of the contract, but that code which returns the code of the contract upon execution.\n\n> Note: While a contract is being created, its code is still empty. Because of that we should call back into the contract under construction until its constructor has finished executing. \n\nBasically you cannot call the functions of the contract that you are deploying inside of the constructor, externally.\n\n> This is assuming that you know that you can call a function internally and externally.\n\n```solidity\n\n//SPDX-License-Idenitifier: MIT\n\npragma solidity 0.8.17;\n\ncontract TransactionTests {\n    uint public constructor_value;\n    uint public constructor_value2;\n    uint public constructor_value3;\n\n    constructor() {\n        constructor_value = generateRandomNumber();\n        constructor_value2 = TransactionTests.generateRandomNumber();\n        // constructor_value3 = address(this).generateRandomNumber();\n    }\n\n    function generateRandomNumber() public view returns (uint) {\n        return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.difficulty, block.number)));\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n### Memory\n\n1. Memory is linear, while storage is not. \n\n2. Memory can also be addressed at byte level.\n\n3. In the GETH (Go implementation of EVM), the memory is represented as an array of bytes.\n\n4. Consider memory as a consecutive (linear) stack where each entry is 1 byte (not 1 word ~ 32 bytes). So, when you will do *MSTORE8(offset, value)*, this will use up one memory slot at the offset mentioned.\n\n5. However, if you did something like *MSTORE(offset, value)*, then this would take up 32 entries in the stack in the following format:\n\n        B32\n\n        B31\n\n        B30\n\n        .\n\n        .\n\n        .\n\n        .\n\n        B3\n\n        B2\n\n        B1\n\nWhere Bn is the nth Byte of the value that you used in  *MSTORE*.\n\n6. During an execution, the whole memory is accessible, but not for free. When an offset(location) is accessed for the first time (either read or write), it may trigger a memory expansion, which will cost gas. A memory expansion may be triggered when the offset used is bigger than any used before. When that happens, the cost of accessing that higher offset is computed and removed from the total gas available in the current context.\n\n7. The cost grows quadratically with the size, making higher offsets more costly and discouraging to use too much memory. Any opcode accessing memory may trigger an expansion (including, for example, MLOAD, RETURN or CALLDATACOPY).\n\nThe exact formula used is:\n```shell\nmemory_size_word = (memory_byte_size + 31) / 32\nmemory_cost = (memory_size_word ** 2) / 512 + (3 * memory_size_word)\n```\n\n### Stack\n\n1. Stack has a width of 32 bytes (1 word) and a depth of 1024 entries.\n\n2. Technically only the topmost stack item is accessible but we do have the option to copy any of the top 16 entries and put it on top of the stack or swap the top element with any of the top 16 entries.\n\n3. Example. This is what happens when you use the *SWAP16* opcode:\n\n        **Stack input**\n        --------\n\n        a: value to swap.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        b: value to swap.\n\n        **Stack output**\n        ------\n\n        b: swapped value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        ignored value.\n\n        a: swapped value."

Web3 protocols are decentralised, therefore there are no centralised authorities, and subsequently there is no regulatory pressure on the protocols to do quality checks on their protocols.\n\nIs this an issue?<br /> **YES** <br />\nIs this a big issue?<br />**YES**\n\nWhy? <br/>\n> Well, because, speaking strictly from an economic perspective, it makes much more sense for a protocol to use its time and developer resources on shipping a v2 of their protocol once the initial set of smart contracts are coded rather than spending it on testing their protocol. The protocols presently, try to, conviniently shift the burden of testing and quality assurance on the auditing firms and sometimes on insurance firms. However, Auditing + Insurance is still not enough to offer the level of peace of mind that people should have on software that handles their money.\n\n> Therefore, the development team, that is the most intimately familar with the code base, must make it a sacred duty of theirs (just like doctors take the [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath)) to test their code to the best of knowledge and ability.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nAll in all, these softwares (DeFi protocols) handle the hard earned money of everyday Joes like you and me (and also money of stupid funds like 3AC, but yeah, you get the point) so, we cannot let the protocols continue with lax testing, because not everything can and should be viewed with an economic lens, somethings should exist simply because of personal or community ethics.\n\nIt does not matter (much) how many auditors have had a stab at your protocol, you, as a developer, do not really understand if your protocol really works and is robust enough to take on the uncertainities of the real world if you have not tested your protocol thoroughly. \n\nTherefore, with this repository, I aim to create a certain set of testing standards that all DeFi protocols should strive to meet.\n\nI plan to create this set of standards via iterations. <br />\nIterations of publicly critiquing leading DeFi protocols that are in use today, so that the up and coming protocols in the same space can get an idea and inspiration for the level of testing that the entire community expects out of a protocol that claims to handle money.\n\n## List of protocols being evaluated\n\n1. [Maple Finance](https://github.com/saxenism/defi-tits/tree/master/Maple%20Finance)\n\n## Random tid bits about traditional testing that I have picked up...\n\nThis is definitely not molded for web3 yet, but consider this a good starting point if you haven't formally studied [Software Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbRMhDVUMngf8oZR3DpKMvYhZKga90JVt).\n\nTesting of software is an extremely imaginative and cognitively demanding task, more so in DeFi. So let your imagination go wild and gather ideas regarding testing from any walk of life, science, religion, parenting, social sciences, etc. Just about everything is fair game in testing.\n\n## 1. Old wisdom related to testing\n\n### 1.1 Presence of bugs\nTesting can esure that defects are present but it cannot prove that a particular software is bug-free. Which isn't something super nice, but I'm coping too.\n\n### 1.2 None can do exhaustive testing\nYour software can never be tested for every imaginable and possible test cases. Trust me fellow crypto bro, you cannot.\n\n### 1.3 Test Early\nEarlier you test, lesser you'll cry.\n\n### 1.4 Defect Clustering\nPareto principle but for origin of software bugs.\n\n### 1.5 Pesticide Paradox\nDon't be an idiot and test the same thing over and over with different methods. Find novel ways to screw with your protocol.\n\n### 1.6 Testing is context-dependent\nEvery protocol does something special. Test the shit out of that.\n\n### 1.7 Absence of errors fallacy\nJust like your hot and caring girlfriend, a 100% bug-free software exists only in your imagination.\n\n\n## 1. Why testing is important\n\n+ Saves you and your users from getting rekt.\n+ Hoping for your protocol's success without adequate testing is like going into a gunfight without a bulletproof vest and hoping you don't get shot.\n+ Time and effort spent on testing can be leveraged to get better terms when you get your protocol insured.\n+ In short, you'll get your lambo only wen you test.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk. Bye.\n\n## Types of testing\n\nFunctional and Non Functional\n\nNon Function includes \n- Testing the Documentation (which includes)\n    - Instructions\n    - Examples\n    - Messages\n    - Samples\n- Installation Testing\n- Performance Testing\n    - Load Testing\n    - Spike Testing\n    - Stress Testing\n    - Endurance Testing\n- Reliability Testing\n    - Feature Testing\n    - Regression testing\n    - Load Test\n    - Objectives Testing\n- Security Testing (web2 stuff)\n    - Access to application\n    - Data Protection\n    - Brute FOrce\n    - SQL Injection\n    - Service Point\n    - Session Management\n    - Error Handling\n    - Specific Risky Functionalities\n\n## 2. SDLC\n\n+ Requirement\n+ Analysis (outcome from this phase is SRS)\n+ Design (HLD and LLD)\n+ Coding\n+ Testing\n+ Deployment and all\n\n### 2.1 Waterfall Model\n\nSequential design process. One way street, so back tracking is not possible.\n\n![Waterfall Model Image](https://www.tutorialscampus.com/sdlc/img/waterfall-model.png)\n\n### 2.2 Spiral Model\n\nCombination of iterative development process model and sequential linear development model.\n\n![Spiral Model Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DJxUCFeVoAA5bt1?format=jpg&name=small)\n\n## 3. Validation vs Verification\n\n| Verification                           | Validation                       |\n| -----------                            | -----------                      |\n| Methods involve: review, inspection, unit testing & integration testing| Involves testing the entire system (system testing)                            |\n| Usually done by developers while developing                              | Usually done by tester and after developing of the product by developers                             |\n|Concerned with the phase containment of errors | Concerned with making the final product error free |\n| Involves static and dynamic analysis of code | Involves only dynamic analysis of code |\n\n## 4. Types of software testing\n\n### 4.1 Unit Testing\n\nCan be done in the development phase itself. Unit means a particularly small piece of (preferrably independent) code such as a function, small module etc.\n\nSmallest element of the software is a unit and testing each of those units is **unit testing**.\n\n### 4.2 Integration Testing\n\nCombine different units of code and test whether they work together as expected to produce the desired output or not.\n\n4 common integration testing startegies are as follows:\n\n#### 4.2.1 Big Bang Testing\n\nAll units are linked at once, resulting in a complete system. Here, it is difficult to isolate any errors found.\n\n#### 4.2.2 Top Down \n\nHigher level modules are tested first after which the lower level modules are tested. Higher level modules refer to the main modules and lower level refers to the sub modules.\n\n**Stubs** (temporary modules) are used to simulate the behaviour of the lower-level modules that are not yet integrated. \n\nUsed when software needs to interact with an external system.\n\n#### 4.2.3 Bottom Up\n\nLower level modules are tested first and then the higher level modules. \n\nThis approach uses **test drivers** which are mainly used to initiate and pass the required data to the sub modules, implying we pass mock data that should ideally have come from (the not yet implemented) higher modules.\n\n#### 4.2.4 Mixed (Sandwiched integration testing)\n\nA mixed integration testing follows a combination of top down and bottom-up testing approaches.\n\n### 4.3 System Testing or End-to-End Testing\n\nTesting the entire system. Here, we navigate all the necessary modules of an application and check if the end features or the end business works fine, and test the product as a whole system.\n\n#### 4.3.1.1 Alpha Testing\n\n+ The testers are people who have built the product.\n+ Done before releasing the product.\n+ Involves both white box and black box testing\n\n#### 4.3.1.2 Beta Testing\n\n+ Beta testing is performed by a select set of clients who are not part of the organization. \n+ User input on the product is collected to ensure the product is ready for real time users\n+ Commonly involves only black box testing\n\n#### 4.3.2 Acceptance Testing\n\nIt is a formal testing according to user needs, requirements and business processes conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria or not and to enable the users, customers or other authorized entities to determine whether to accept the system or not.\n\n##### Smoke Testing or Build Verification Testing\n\n+ Subset of acceptance testing\n\n| Smoke Testing | Sanity Testing |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Smoke testing is done to assure that the acute functionalities of program is working fine. | Sanity testing is done to check the bugs have been fixed after the build. |\n| Smoke testing is documented. | Sanity testing isn’t documented. |\n| Smoke testing is done to measures the stability of the system/product by performing testing. | Sanity testing is done to measures the rationality of the system/product by performing testing. |\n| Smoke testing can be performed either manually or by using automation tools. | Sanity testing is commonly executed manually, not by using any automation approach. |\n| Smoke testing is used to test all over function of the system/product. | Sanity testing is used in the case of only modified or defect functions of system/products. |\n|Smoke testing is performed when new product is built. |Sanity testing is conducted after the completion of regression testing.|\n\n\n#### 4.3.3 Mutation Testing\n\n+ Type of white box testing\n+ Extremely costly and time consuming but also extremely efficient in finding errors and ambiguities\n+ In this type of testing, you slightly change the value/logic/statements in your code and see if you get the expected output in your tests\n\n#### 4.3.4 Performance / Non functional Testing\n\nNon-functional testing is defined as a type of software testing to check non-functional aspects of a software application. It is designed to test the readiness of a system as per nonfunctional parameters which are never addressed by functional testing.\n\nThis testing tests the following things (among others):\n+ Volume\n+ Load\n+ Stress\n+ Security\n+ Configuration \n+ Compatibility (BrowserStack :P)\n+ Recovery\n+ Installation etc\n\n#### 4.3.5 Recovery Testing in Software Testing\n\n+ Recovery testing is a type of system testing which aims at testing whether a system can recover from failures or not.\n+ To ensure that a system is fault-tolerant and can recover well from failures, recovery testing is important to perform.\n\n### 4.4 Regression Testing\n\nRegression testing is the process of testing the modified parts of the code and the parts that might get affected due to the modification to ensure that no new errors have been introduced in the software after the modifications have been made.\n\n#### 4.4.1 Techniques for the selection of test cases for regression testing\n\n+ Select all test cases (Most thorough but inefficient approach)\n+ Select test cases randomly (Dangerous approach)\n+ Select modification traversing test cases (Huge upfront work required to identify these test cases)\n+ Select higher priority test cases (Assign priority values to all your tests, then re-test all your highest priority tests)\n\n#### 4.4.2 Sanity Testing\n\n+ Subset if regression testing\n+ Done to ensure that the code changes that have been made are working properly or not\n+ Focus of the team during sanity testing is to validate the functionality of the application and not detailed testing\n+ Usually performed on builds where the production deployment is required immediately like a critical bug fix.\n+ Performed only after the software product has passed the smoke test and the QA team has accepted for further testing\n\n## 5. STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)\n\n+ Requirement Analysis (Truly truly understand what your protocol is supposed to do)\n+ Test Planning / Strategy Phase (Based on the context of the protocol in question, zero in on a testing strategy)\n+ Test Case Development (This should take the maximum amout of time. List down all test cases that you think are appropriate.)\n+ Environment Setup (Independent of other stages) (Don't tell me you don't already have Forge installed)\n+ Test Execution (Code up all the test cases you came up with earlier. You can do back and forth between Test Execution and Case Development phase, but try to keep it minimal)\n+ Test Cycle Closure (Create a good report. Remember, chads keep their work presentable)\n\n## 6. Non Functional Testing\n\n+ This is based on customer expectations as opposed to functional testing which is based on customer requirements.\n+ Non functional testing describes how the product works rather that what the product does\n+ Includes things like performance testing, scalability, volume testing, load testing, stress testing etc.\n\n### 6.1 Performace Testing\n\n+ Ensures software application will perform well under their expected workload\n+ Goal is not to find bugs but to elimiate performance bottle-necks\n+ Provides accurate information about the speed, scalability and stability of the software\n+ Types of performance testing types\n    + Load Testing (Multiple users access application simultaneously)\n    + Stress Testing\n    + Endurance Testing\n    + Spiking Testing\n    + Volume & Scalability Testing \n+ Pay attention to:\n    + Long load time\n    + Poor response time\n    + Poor scalability\n    + Bottlenecking\n+ Examples of performance Test cases:\n    + Verify response time is not more than 4 seconds when 1000 users access the website simultaneously \n    + Check the maximum number of users that the application can handle before it crashes\n    + Verify response time of the application under low, normal, moderate and heavy load conditions\n\n### 6.2 Cross browser Tests and Mobile Testing and API Testing\n\nSee if this is applicable and test if you have the resources to do so.\n\nTypes of API Testing\n\n+ Functionality Testing\n+ Reliability Testing\n+ Load Testing\n+ UI/UX Testing\n+ Interoperability Testing\n+ Security Testing\n+ Penetration Testing\n+ Negative Testing\n\n## 7. Agile Testing (Test Driven Development (TDD))\n\n+ Testing is continuous\n+ Continuous Feedback\n+ Decreased time of feedback response\n+ Less documentation\n+ Test Drive\n+ Simplified Code\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8oKMUr3.png)\n\n\n## 7. Software Testing Documentation\n\n### 7.1 Test Plan\n\nProvides the outline strategy which will be implemented for testing the application and also the resources that will be required. Test environement will also be described.\n\nMake sure that you also set up a *defect/bug life cycle*\n\n### 7.2 Test Scenario\n\nNotifies the area in which your application will experiment\n\n### 7.3 Test Case\n\nCollected steps and conditions with inputs that can be implemented at the time of testing. \n\n### 7.4 Traceability Matrix\n\nA table where you can relate test case IDs with protocol requirement IDs. \n\n## 8. Defect Management Process (What to do when you find bugs)\n\n+ Detect the defect\n+ Formulate the bug report\n+ Fix bug\n+ Bug list creation (so that, yk, history doesn't repeat itself and everyone sees that you have 3 brain cells)\n\nIt is important to note in the first two points, whenever you encounter a bug, you have to reach to the root cause of the bug and report that. Because, it is very much possible that the actual coding error that caused the bug might create many more bugs in the future.\n\nIn short, treat the root cause and not just the symptoms.\n\n## 9. When to choose manual testing\n\n### 9.1 Exploratory Testing\n\nCarried out by domain experts.\nMinimal planning\n\n### 9.2 Usability Testing\n\nUser friendliness of an app\n\n### 9.3 Ad Hoc Testing\n\nInformal testing.\nNo documents are followed.\n\n### 9.4 How to do manual testing\n1. Understand the requirements\n2. Write the test cases\n3. Conducting the tests\n4. Log Good Bug Reports\n5. Report the results (Detailed test report)\n\n## What to automate?\n\n+ Repetitive Task\n+ Capturing Results\n+ Data Entry Tasks\n+ Timing or Screening Responsiveness\n+ Non functional Testing\n+ Environment Setup/Tear down\n\n## Approaches to Test Automation (Look them up)\n\n+ Code driven Testing\n+ Graphical User Interface\n+ Framework Approach\n    + Linear Scripting framework\n    + Data driven framework\n    + Keyword driven framework\n    + Modular testing framework\n    + Hybrid Testing Framework"

          "content": "Let's set the records straight.\n\nWeb3 is as much a social movement as it is a technological one.\n\nBitcoin was born as a result of the cumulation of people's hopelessness and disgust at the status quo.\n\nEvery day joes like you and I were appalled by the completely arbitrary (and unjust) exercise of power by the people in power in times of crisis.\n\nDuring the 2008 economic crisis, people realised that *their* money wasn't really theirs. And, people were desperate for something that they can say was truly theirs.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nBitcoin was the answer for these people.\n\nFast forward to today, we talk about an enhanced version of Bitcoin called Web3, which was birthed by Ethereum.\n\nNow, web3 means *decentralised applications*, where your *accounts* cannot be frozen simply because someone in a privileged position does not like you. It means, the flow of *your* money is extremely transparent and you can track your money to the last gwei and see where it is being spent.\n\nWeb3 means that you do not have to *trust* anyone with your money.\n\nThe code is the law and whatever the code says, will happen with your money. No one can take your money and take degen bets with it (unless you want them to).\n\nBut Rahul, things like these happen all the time. Look at Celcius, Vauld, 3AC, Bitfinex etc.\n\nYes, I know, and this is where I want to set the records straight.\n\nJust because an application deals in crypto-currency or uses blockchain does not mean it is *decentralised*. If you have backend servers and databases (with an admin and passwords and all that circus) and you still use blockchain for a specific purpose, then yes, you can claim your website uses blockchain. But, saying your website is decentralised would be a flat-out lie.\n\nAs users, we must recognise the degree of centralisation in an application before we lend it our money.\n\nSure, exchanges like Vauld, Celcius etc are completely centralised and they can do whatever they feel like with your funds, but there are many other *decentralised applications* which are also not much decentralised simply because they use (token weighted) voting to take decisions and a minority of the users are majority token holders. For more context, read more about the Solend saga that went down just a few weeks back.\n\nThe bottom line here is that it is a choice. A very simple one.\n\nIf you do not want any hassle in regards to your money and want to rely on the goodwill of others, go ahead with your traditional banks and NBFCs. However, if you want a certain extent of *control* over your finances, start reading about how DeFi works.\n\nThank you & Godspeed."
