# The Bar-Rasing Games

Security of any kind, especially smart contract security is a field where you have to constantly keep on learning and evolving. Staying ahead of the curve is the only possible way to thrive in the badlands of security.

This page documents what would I be focussing on for the coming days and weeks. The study materials and subjects mentioned here, would get my time and attention apart from my regular job and audits and bug hunts. 

The content of the list below is simply there so that I do not loose the war, whilst I fight the battles everyday. Feel free to take up and customize anything or everything from this list.

I will be adding all the things that I read or create or do in regards of the topics mentioned here, date-wise. So, if something starts looking good, I'll combine that into a article and release it publicly.

# Subject List

## 1. Formal Language and Theory of Computation

+ A good, well-recommended resource to learn about this subject: [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-404j-theory-of-computation-fall-2020/resources/introduction-finite-automata-regular-expressions/).
    + Remember, this time you are studying this subject to actually understand the subject and not to get a passing grade in your dumb college semester exams.
+ Main auditing methodology of [Trust](https://www.trust-security.xyz/), who is perhaps **the hottest** auditing prospect out there right now. Need to explore how this works.
+ An article that explains how he utilizes formal language to find those obscure bugs: [Fluidity $50k bug](https://www.trust-security.xyz/post/breaking-fluidity-for-glory-and-50k)
+ A [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/trust__90/status/1661421025920155649?s=20) explaining his process.

## 2. Formal Verification using Certora

+ A good, well-recommended resource to learn about this subject: 
    + [Certora's Github Self-paced Course](https://github.com/Certora/Tutorials)
    + [Certora's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKtu7wuOMP9XHbjAevkw2nL29YMubqEFj)
+ This feels like a natural next-step after learning in-depth about the Theory of computation and formal verification. The Certora prover is like a practical, smart-contract specific implementation of the theory you learnt in formal language.
+ Why do this? 
    + This is a rare skill, that is truly technical. This gives you a far-better competitive edge compared to other auditors.
    + You can advertise this skill and use the novely to attract way more clients.
    + This will allow me to charge much more for this skill compared to just auditing stuff.
    + This would provide me with a fundamental base for my auditing and help me not feel like a fraud :P

## 3. Invariant Testing

+ Patrick Collins talks a lot about this and this is something that should be a **must** across all testing suites of different protocols.
+ This should be a pretty straight-forward skill to pick up. After all this is just stateful fuzz testing, right? 
+ Here are some resources to pick this skill up:
    + [Short introduction to invariant testing](https://patrickalphac.medium.com/fuzz-invariant-tests-the-new-bare-minimum-for-smart-contract-security-87ebe150e88c)
    + [Cyfrin live testing a protocol with invariant testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpzxQMLgqE8)
    + [Horsefact's OG article on invariant testing](https://mirror.xyz/horsefacts.eth/Jex2YVaO65dda6zEyfM_-DXlXhOWCAoSpOx5PLocYgw)
