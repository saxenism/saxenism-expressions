# DeFi Dictionary

Here is a collection of finance terms and concepts I come across while auditing several codebases. Collecting them all here for easy access for myself in the future and possibly helping out other developers in the community.

## L

### LTV (Loan To Value)

1. LTV stands for Loan-To-Value ratio.
2. Lenders assess the LTV ratio to determine the level of exposure to risk they take on when underwriting a mortgage.
3. Example:
    a. Suppose you buy a home with a market value of $100_000
    b. However, the owner agrees to sell it to you at $90_000.
    c. If you make a down payment of $10_000, then you'll have to take a loan of $80_000
    d. In this case, your LTV ratio is 80_000/100_000 = 80%
    e. If you instead made a down payment of $15_000, then you'll have to take a loan of $75_000
    f. In that case, your LTV ratio is 75_000/100_000 = 75%.
4. Therefore from a lender's perspective, the lower the LTV ratio the safer the lending is for them.
