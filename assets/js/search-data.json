            "content": "General Contract Development Guidelines (Best Practices) . Smart contract programming requires a different engineering mindset than what you may be used to. . The cost of failure is high and changes can be difficult, making it in some ways similar to hardware programming or financial services programming rather than web or mobile app development. . It is therefore not enough to defend against known vulnerabilities. Instead you will need to learn a new philosophy of development. . Prepare for Failure . Place circuit breakers | Manage money at risk (rate limiting, maximum usage,etc) | Effective mechanism for proxy upgrades | . Stay up to Date . Check your contracts for any new bug as soon as it is discovered | Keep on upgrading all tools and libraries | Adopt new security techniques that emerge (and seem useful) | . Keep it simple . Keep contract logic simple. Modularize code. Use already written code, use as many lego blocks as you can, before writing custom logic | Clarity over performance (Debatable) For example one could argue that the OpenSea Seaport contract is so damned performant that it affects the auditability of the contracts. But realise the fact that the Seaport contract will be deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and will be used to mint hundereds of thousands of NFTs, saving the users millions of dollars over the course of time. . So, based on the nature of your contract, do have healthy, sane discussions on whether you will place more impetus on performance or clarity. . | Roll out in phases. Have a bug bounty in place, test your code-base thoroughly and immediately add relevant tests to your codebase as soon as a new attack is discovered. | . Blockchain Properties . Randomness can be gamified. | Timestamps are imprecise. Miners can influence the time of execution of a txn within a margin of several seconds | Beware of external calls. Private data is not actually private and public functions can be called by anyone in any order. | Prefer reusing contract code only when you have proven previously-deployed contracts which you own. Otherwise go for duplication of code. Efforts such as OpenZeppelin’s Solidity Library seek to provide patterns such that secure code can be re-used without duplication . | . Development best practices: . External calls are very risky. Try and avoid doing that, prefer duplicating code over using a call to an external contract. | And when you absolutely have to do that, make sure that the contract is owned/maintained/managed by a trusted party. | Always mark your function making external calls as unsafe via comments and naming convention | Avoid making state changes after the external call. The usual re-entrancy attack and following the check-effects-interactions pattern circus. | . | | .",

            "content": "The International Testing Standard (TITS) for DeFi . DeFi Testing is broken. Doesn&#39;t matter how many auditors had a stab at your protocol, if you haven&#39;t sufficiently tested your protocol, you are basically gambling with your user&#39;s funds. Creating a repo to publicly critique the quality of the test suite of major DeFi protocols. . &mdash; Rahul Saxena 🦀🦀 (@saxenism) July 27, 2022 Mission Statement . I believe that protocols need to be held to a higher standard of testing. Web3 protocols are decentralised, therefore there are no centralised authorities, and subsequently there is no regulatory pressure on the protocols to do quality checks on their protocols. . Is this an issue? YES Is this a big issue?YES . Why? . Well, because, speaking strictly from an economic perspective, it makes much more sense for a protocol to use its time and developer resources on shipping a v2 of their protocol once the initial set of smart contracts are coded rather than spending it on testing their protocol. The protocols presently, try to, conviniently shift the burden of testing and quality assurance on the auditing firms and sometimes on insurance firms. However, Auditing + Insurance is still not enough to offer the level of peace of mind that people should have on software that handles their money. . Therefore, the development team, that is the most intimately familar with the code base, must make it a sacred duty of theirs (just like doctors take the Hippocratic Oath) to test their code to the best of knowledge and ability. . All in all, these softwares (DeFi protocols) handle the hard earned money of everyday Joes like you and me (and also money of stupid funds like 3AC, but yeah, you get the point) so, we cannot let the protocols continue with lax testing, because not everything can and should be viewed with an economic lens, somethings should exist simply because of personal or community ethics. . It does not matter (much) how many auditors have had a stab at your protocol, you, as a developer, do not really understand if your protocol really works and is robust enough to take on the uncertainities of the real world if you have not tested your protocol thoroughly. . Therefore, with this repository, I aim to create a certain set of testing standards that all DeFi protocols should strive to meet. . I plan to create this set of standards via iterations. Iterations of publicly critiquing leading DeFi protocols that are in use today, so that the up and coming protocols in the same space can get an idea and inspiration for the level of testing that the entire community expects out of a protocol that claims to handle money. . List of protocols being evaluated . Maple Finance | Random tid bits about traditional testing that I have picked up… . This is definitely not molded for web3 yet, but consider this a good starting point if you haven’t formally studied Software Engineering. . Testing of software is an extremely imaginative and cognitively demanding task, more so in DeFi. So let your imagination go wild and gather ideas regarding testing from any walk of life, science, religion, parenting, social sciences, etc. Just about everything is fair game in testing. . 1. Old wisdom related to testing . 1.1 Presence of bugs . Testing can esure that defects are present but it cannot prove that a particular software is bug-free. Which isn’t something super nice, but I’m coping too. . 1.2 None can do exhaustive testing . Your software can never be tested for every imaginable and possible test cases. Trust me fellow crypto bro, you cannot. . 1.3 Test Early . Earlier you test, lesser you’ll cry. . 1.4 Defect Clustering . Pareto principle but for origin of software bugs. . 1.5 Pesticide Paradox . Don’t be an idiot and test the same thing over and over with different methods. Find novel ways to screw with your protocol. . 1.6 Testing is context-dependent . Every protocol does something special. Test the shit out of that. . 1.7 Absence of errors fallacy . Just like your hot and caring girlfriend, a 100% bug-free software exists only in your imagination. . 1. Why testing is important . Saves you and your users from getting rekt. | Hoping for your protocol’s success without adequate testing is like going into a gunfight without a bulletproof vest and hoping you don’t get shot. | Time and effort spent on testing can be leveraged to get better terms when you get your protocol insured. | In short, you’ll get your lambo only wen you test. | . Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Bye. . Types of testing . Functional and Non Functional . Non Function includes .

SDLC . Requirement | Analysis (outcome from this phase is SRS) | Design (HLD and LLD) | Coding | Testing | Deployment and all | . 2.1 Waterfall Model . Sequential design process. One way street, so back tracking is not possible. . . 2.2 Spiral Model . Combination of iterative development process model and sequential linear development model. . . 3. Validation vs Verification . Verification Validation . Methods involve: review, inspection, unit testing &amp; integration testing | Involves testing the entire system (system testing) | . Usually done by developers while developing | Usually done by tester and after developing of the product by developers | . Concerned with the phase containment of errors | Concerned with making the final product error free | . Involves static and dynamic analysis of code | Involves only dynamic analysis of code | . 4. Types of software testing . 4.1 Unit Testing . Can be done in the development phase itself. Unit means a particularly small piece of (preferrably independent) code such as a function, small module etc. . Smallest element of the software is a unit and testing each of those units is unit testing. . 4.2 Integration Testing . Combine different units of code and test whether they work together as expected to produce the desired output or not. . 4 common integration testing startegies are as follows: . 4.2.1 Big Bang Testing . All units are linked at once, resulting in a complete system. Here, it is difficult to isolate any errors found. . 4.2.2 Top Down . Higher level modules are tested first after which the lower level modules are tested. Higher level modules refer to the main modules and lower level refers to the sub modules. . Stubs (temporary modules) are used to simulate the behaviour of the lower-level modules that are not yet integrated. . Used when software needs to interact with an external system. . 4.2.3 Bottom Up . Lower level modules are tested first and then the higher level modules. . This approach uses test drivers which are mainly used to initiate and pass the required data to the sub modules, implying we pass mock data that should ideally have come from (the not yet implemented) higher modules. . 4.2.4 Mixed (Sandwiched integration testing) . A mixed integration testing follows a combination of top down and bottom-up testing approaches. . 4.3 System Testing or End-to-End Testing . Testing the entire system. Here, we navigate all the necessary modules of an application and check if the end features or the end business works fine, and test the product as a whole system. . 4.3.1.1 Alpha Testing . The testers are people who have built the product. | Done before releasing the product. | Involves both white box and black box testing | . 4.3.1.2 Beta Testing . Beta testing is performed by a select set of clients who are not part of the organization. | User input on the product is collected to ensure the product is ready for real time users | Commonly involves only black box testing | . 4.3.2 Acceptance Testing . It is a formal testing according to user needs, requirements and business processes conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria or not and to enable the users, customers or other authorized entities to determine whether to accept the system or not. . Smoke Testing or Build Verification Testing . Subset of acceptance testing | . Smoke Testing Sanity Testing . Smoke testing is done to assure that the acute functionalities of program is working fine. | Sanity testing is done to check the bugs have been fixed after the build. | . Smoke testing is documented. | Sanity testing isn’t documented. | . Smoke testing is done to measures the stability of the system/product by performing testing. | Sanity testing is done to measures the rationality of the system/product by performing testing. | . Smoke testing can be performed either manually or by using automation tools. | Sanity testing is commonly executed manually, not by using any automation approach. | . Smoke testing is used to test all over function of the system/product. | Sanity testing is used in the case of only modified or defect functions of system/products. | . Smoke testing is performed when new product is built. | Sanity testing is conducted after the completion of regression testing. | . 4.3.3 Mutation Testing . Type of white box testing | Extremely costly and time consuming but also extremely efficient in finding errors and ambiguities | In this type of testing, you slightly change the value/logic/statements in your code and see if you get the expected output in your tests | . 4.3.4 Performance / Non functional Testing . Non-functional testing is defined as a type of software testing to check non-functional aspects of a software application. It is designed to test the readiness of a system as per nonfunctional parameters which are never addressed by functional testing. . This testing tests the following things (among others): . Volume | Load | Stress | Security | Configuration | Compatibility (BrowserStack :P) | Recovery | Installation etc | . 4.3.5 Recovery Testing in Software Testing . Recovery testing is a type of system testing which aims at testing whether a system can recover from failures or not. | To ensure that a system is fault-tolerant and can recover well from failures, recovery testing is important to perform. | . 4.4 Regression Testing . Regression testing is the process of testing the modified parts of the code and the parts that might get affected due to the modification to ensure that no new errors have been introduced in the software after the modifications have been made. . 4.4.1 Techniques for the selection of test cases for regression testing . Select all test cases (Most thorough but inefficient approach) | Select test cases randomly (Dangerous approach) | Select modification traversing test cases (Huge upfront work required to identify these test cases) | Select higher priority test cases (Assign priority values to all your tests, then re-test all your highest priority tests) | . 4.4.2 Sanity Testing . Subset if regression testing | Done to ensure that the code changes that have been made are working properly or not | Focus of the team during sanity testing is to validate the functionality of the application and not detailed testing | Usually performed on builds where the production deployment is required immediately like a critical bug fix. | Performed only after the software product has passed the smoke test and the QA team has accepted for further testing | . 5. STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) . Requirement Analysis (Truly truly understand what your protocol is supposed to do) | Test Planning / Strategy Phase (Based on the context of the protocol in question, zero in on a testing strategy) | Test Case Development (This should take the maximum amout of time. List down all test cases that you think are appropriate.) | Environment Setup (Independent of other stages) (Don’t tell me you don’t already have Forge installed) | Test Execution (Code up all the test cases you came up with earlier. You can do back and forth between Test Execution and Case Development phase, but try to keep it minimal) | Test Cycle Closure (Create a good report. Remember, chads keep their work presentable) | . 6. Non Functional Testing . This is based on customer expectations as opposed to functional testing which is based on customer requirements. | Non functional testing describes how the product works rather that what the product does | Includes things like performance testing, scalability, volume testing, load testing, stress testing etc. | . 6.1 Performace Testing . Ensures software application will perform well under their expected workload | Goal is not to find bugs but to elimiate performance bottle-necks | Provides accurate information about the speed, scalability and stability of the software | Types of performance testing types Load Testing (Multiple users access application simultaneously) | Stress Testing | Endurance Testing | Spiking Testing | Volume &amp; Scalability Testing | . | Pay attention to: Long load time | Poor response time | Poor scalability | Bottlenecking | . | Examples of performance Test cases: Verify response time is not more than 4 seconds when 1000 users access the website simultaneously | Check the maximum number of users that the application can handle before it crashes | Verify response time of the application under low, normal, moderate and heavy load conditions | . | . 6.2 Cross browser Tests and Mobile Testing and API Testing . See if this is applicable and test if you have the resources to do so. . Types of API Testing . Functionality Testing | Reliability Testing | Load Testing | UI/UX Testing | Interoperability Testing | Security Testing | Penetration Testing | Negative Testing | . 7. Agile Testing (Test Driven Development (TDD)) . Testing is continuous | Continuous Feedback | Decreased time of feedback response | Less documentation | Test Drive | Simplified Code | . . 7. Software Testing Documentation . 7.1 Test Plan . Provides the outline strategy which will be implemented for testing the application and also the resources that will be required. Test environement will also be described. . Make sure that you also set up a defect/bug life cycle . 7.2 Test Scenario . Notifies the area in which your application will experiment . 7.3 Test Case . Collected steps and conditions with inputs that can be implemented at the time of testing. . 7.4 Traceability Matrix . A table where you can relate test case IDs with protocol requirement IDs. . 8. Defect Management Process (What to do when you find bugs) . Detect the defect | Formulate the bug report | Fix bug | Bug list creation (so that, yk, history doesn’t repeat itself and everyone sees that you have 3 brain cells) | . It is important to note in the first two points, whenever you encounter a bug, you have to reach to the root cause of the bug and report that. Because, it is very much possible that the actual coding error that caused the bug might create many more bugs in the future. . In short, treat the root cause and not just the symptoms. . 9. When to choose manual testing . 9.1 Exploratory Testing . Carried out by domain experts. Minimal planning . 9.2 Usability Testing . User friendliness of an app . 9.3 Ad Hoc Testing . Informal testing. No documents are followed. . 9.4 How to do manual testing . Understand the requirements | Write the test cases | Conducting the tests | Log Good Bug Reports | Report the results (Detailed test report) | What to automate? . Repetitive Task | Capturing Results | Data Entry Tasks | Timing or Screening Responsiveness | Non functional Testing | Environment Setup/Tear down | . Approaches to Test Automation (Look them up) . Code driven Testing | Graphical User Interface | Framework Approach Linear Scripting framework | Data driven framework | Keyword driven framework | Modular testing framework | Hybrid Testing Framework | . | .",

            "title": "Enums",
            "content": "What are enums in Solidity? . enums or members of enumerated lists, in Solidity work much like enums in any other language. For me, it is basically a tool to reduce the stress on my mental RAM while writing code or smart contracts. . Typical Use Case: . Suppose you want to give your user an option to choose his favorite squad among 9 available options. The available options would be: . Black Bull | Silver Eagle | Blue Rose | Golden Dawn | Green Mantis | Crimson Lion | Aqua Deer | Purple Orca | Coral Peacock | . Suppose you intend to use the variable favSquad to denote your user’s favorite Black Clover squad and use that variable in subsequent logic. . One option (particularly messy one) would be to allow users to enter strings that denote their favorite squads, but that would bring forth a whole new hell of matching proper cases (upper cases and lower cases), also someone could enter a string that is out of scope, like Spade Kingdom for example. . Another option would be to assign numbers to each squad (0-8) based on their index, most probably like a mapping. That would work, but you’ll have to always remember which number represents which squad while coding, which would be pretty uncomfortable. . Hence, we pivot towards using enums. Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called enums. With the use of enums it is possible to reduce the number of bugs in your code. This helps you to not make a mistake, to enter something out of the domain, while entering data and also improves the program readability. . For example, this is how we would use enums: . pragma solidity ^ 0.8.0; contract testEnums { enum CloverSquad { BlackBull, GoldenDawn, SilverEagle, BlueRose, CrimsonLion, GreenMantis, CoralPeacock, PurpleOrca, AquaDeer } CloverSquad favSquad; CloverSquad firstRankedSquad = CloverSquad.GoldenDawn; function getFirstRankedSquad() public view returns (CloverSquad) { return firstRandkedSquad; } } . Taking enum inputs and checking invalid inputs . A question that might arise in your minds (it did in mine too 😅) is how do we take enums as input from the user of our smart contract. We do this by typecasting the enums and checking if it is out of range or not. . Example: . // Yes, you can use your enums in mappings. mapping (address =&gt; CloverSquad) public playerSquad; function selectFavoriteSquad(uint userFavSquad) external { require(userFavSquad &lt;= uint(CloverSquads.AquaDeer), &quot;Choose from 0 to 8&quot;); playerSquad[msg.sender] = CloverSquad(userFavSquad); // Further Logic.... } . Further Reading . That is about everything that you will need to know about enums to be well on your way, but if you really want to get deeper into enums, I would suggest reading this incredibly detailed article on enums. . Thank you &amp; Godspeed. .",

            "title": "CryptoZombies - Lesson 5",
            "content": "Lesson 5: . Tokens on Ethereum: A token on Ethereum is basically just a smart contract that follows some common rules — namely it implements a standard set of functions that all other token contracts share. The token standard that’s a much better fit for crypto-collectibles like CryptoZombies — is called ERC721 tokens. ERC721 tokens are not interchangeable since each one is assumed to be unique, and are not divisible. You can only trade them in whole units, and each one has a unique ID. using a standard like ERC721 has the benefit that we don’t have to implement the auction or escrow logic within our contract that determines how players can trade / sell our zombies. If we conform to the spec, someone else could build an exchange platform for crypto-tradable ERC721 assets, and our ERC721 zombies would be usable on that platform. So there are clear benefits to using a token standard instead of rolling your own trading logic. . | The contract of ERC721 standard looks pretty much like an interface, waiting to be implemented: contract ERC721 { event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId); event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId); function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256); function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address); function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable; function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable; } . | In Solidity, we can inheirt from multiple contracts. . | To avoid overflows and underflows, we use the SafeMath library. A library is a special type of contract in Solidity. One of the things it is useful for is to attach functions to native data types. For example, with the SafeMath library, we’ll use the syntax using SafeMath for uint256. The SafeMath library has 4 functions — add, sub, mul, and div. And now we can access these functions from uint256 as follows: using SafeMath for uint256; uint256 a = 5; uint256 b = a.add(3); // 5 + 3 = 8 uint256 c = a.mul(2); // 5 * 2 = 10 . | assert is similar to require, where it will throw an error if false. The difference between assert and require is that require will refund the user the rest of their gas when a function fails, whereas assert will not. So most of the time you want to use require in your code; assert is typically used when something has gone horribly wrong with the code (like a uint overflow). . | The standard in the Solidity community is to use a format called natspec. | Also, thanks for Loom Network for bringing such awesome animations to us :D . .

Both of these don’t cost any gas to call if they’re called from outside the contract, but the do cost gas if called internally by another function because the calling function is eventually making changes on the blockchain. | The function modifiers can all be stacked together on a function definition, as follows: function test() external view onlyOwner anotherModifier { // Some function-y stuff } . | The payable modifier: They are a special type of functions that can recieve Ether. In Ethereum, because both the money (Ether), the data (transaction payload), and the contract code itself all live on Ethereum, it’s possible for you to call a function and pay money to the contract at the same time. This allows us to have some really cool logic, such as: requiring a certain payment to the contract in order to execute a function. Here’s an example: contract OnlineStore { function buySomething () external payable { require(msg.value == 0.01 ether); //ether is an inbuilt uint; transferStuff(msg.sender); } } . msg.value is a way to see how much Ether was sent to the contract. If a function is not marked as payable, and you try to send Ether to it, the function will reject your transaction. . | The payment can only be done to a data type that’s called address payable. Example: function withdraw() external onlyOwner() { address payable _owner = address(uint16(owner())); _owner.transfer(address(this).balance); } address(this).balance will return the total balance stored on the contract. . | A make-shift way of generating random numbers in Solidity is as follows: // Generate a random number between 1 and 100: uint randNonce = 0; uint random = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(now, msg.sender, randNonce))) % 100; randNonce++; uint random2 = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(now, msg.sender, randNonce))) % 100; . But, this is unsafe, because technically, this can be hacked. How? Read on: In Ethereum, when you call a function on a contract, you broadcast it to a node or nodes on the network as a transaction. The nodes on the network then collect a bunch of transactions, try to be the first to solve a computationally-intensive mathematical problem as a “Proof of Work”, and then publish that group of transactions along with their Proof of Work (PoW) as a block to the rest of the network. Once a node has solved the PoW, the other nodes stop trying to solve the PoW, verify that the other node’s list of transactions are valid, and then accept the block and move on to trying to solve the next block. This makes our random number function exploitable. Let’s say we had a coin flip contract —heads you double your money, tails you lose everything. Let’s say it used the above random function to determine heads or tails. (random &gt;= 50 is heads, random &lt; 50 is tails). If I were running a node, I could publish a transaction only to my own node and not share it. I could then run the coin flip function to see if I won — and if I lost, choose not to include that transaction in the next block I’m solving. I could keep doing this indefinitely until I finally won the coin flip and solved the next block, and profit. . | One relatively safe method is to use an Oracle to access a random number from outside the Ethereum blockchain | .

For this reason, if often makes sense to have functions that will allow you to update key portions of your dApp | Ownable contract: Owners(contract creators) have special priviliges. It has the following three functions: a. When a contract is deployed, its constructor sets the owner to msg.sender (the person who deployed it) b. It adds an onlyOwner modifier, which can restirct access to certain functions to only the owner c. It allows you to transfer the contract to a new owner | Once you inherit from the Ownable contract, you can use the onlyOwner function modifier. This ensures that the function caller is indeed the contract owner or not | In Solidity, your users have to pay every time they execute a function on your DApp using a currency called gas. So, basically, users have to spend ETH in order to execute functions on your DApp. | How much gas is required to execute a function depends on how complex that function’s logic is. Each individual operation has a gas cost based roughly on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation. The total gas cost of your function is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations. Therefore, code optimization is much much more important in Ethereum than in other programming languages. Because, if your code is slopp, then your users are going to pay a premium to execute your functions – and this could add up to millions of dollars in unnecessary fees across thousand of users. | Choosing either of uint8, uint16, uint32, uint256 will result in the same gas fee because Ethereum reserves the same space for each, irrespective of what uint you choose. But you can save on costs when working with multiple uints inside of a struct. Also, for this to happen, you would want to cluster identical data types together (ie put them next to each other in the struct) | Solidity provides some native units for dealing with time. The variable now will return the current unix timestamp of the latest block (the number of seconds that have passed since January 1st 1970). Solidity also contains the time units seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks and years. | We can pass a storage pointer to a struct as an argument to a private or internal function. | An important security practice is to examine all your public and external functions, and try to think of ways users might abuse them. Because, unless these functions have a modifier like onlyOwner, any user can call them and pass them any data they want to. | The custom function modifier (like onlyOwner) can also take some parameters. The following example will clear things up: mapping (uint =&gt; uint) public age; // Modifier that requires this user to be older than a certain age: modifier olderThan(uint _age, uint _userId) { require(age[_userId] &gt;= _age); _; } function driveCar(uint _userId) public olderThan(16, _userId) { // Some function logic } . | Remember how we used memory pointer type along with string in function parameters. Similar to memory we have calldata but it’s only available to external functions | Since view functions only needs to query your local Ethereum node to run the function, it doesn’t actually have to create a transaction on the blockchain, which would need to run on every single node, and cost gas. Therefore, view functions don’t cost any gas when they’re called externally by a user. Optimize your DApp’s gas usage for your users by using read-only external view functions wherever possible. If a view function is called internally from another function in the same contract that is not a view function, it will still cost gas. This is because the other function creates a transaction on Ethereum, and will still need to be verified from every node. So view functions are only free when they’re called externally. | One of the more expensive operations in Solidity is using storage — particularly writes. This is because every time you write or change a piece of data, it’s written permanently to the blockchain. Forever! Thousands of nodes across the world need to store that data on their hard drives, and this amount of data keeps growing over time as the blockchain grows. So there’s a cost to doing that. In order to keep costs down, you want to avoid writing data to storage except when absolutely necessary. Sometimes this involves seemingly inefficient programming logic — like rebuilding an array in memory every time a function is called instead of simply saving that array in a variable for quick lookups. In most programming languages, looping over large data sets is expensive. But in Solidity, this is way cheaper than using storage if it’s in an external view function, since view functions don’t cost your users any gas. (And gas costs your users real money!). An example illustrating how to declare arrays in memory: function getArray() external pure returns(uint[] memory) { // Instantiate a new array in memory with a length of 3 uint[] memory values = new uint[](3); // Put some values to it values[0] = 1; values[1] = 2; values[2] = 3; return values; } . | for loops will be preferred over mapping solutions, if it can save gas cost. | .

All variables and functions belong to a contract and this will be the starting point of all projects | State Variables: Permanently stored in contract storage (they are written to the Ethereum Blockchain) Think of declaring state variables like writing to a DB | Arithmetic operations: x+y, x-y, x*y, x/y, x%y, x**y(same as x^y) | structs struct Person { uint age; string name; } . | Arrays {Possible to create an array of structs as well as native data types} Fixed arrays -&gt; uint [2] fixedArr Dynamic arrays -&gt; uint [] dynamicArr If an array is declared as public, other contracts can read from but not write to this array | function createZombies (string memory _name, uint _dna) public { underscore is a naming convention to separate the private variables from the global variables(_name) } . Notice the word memory along with the string parameter, it signifies that _name would be memory and not in stack, therefore would not be written to the blockchain, hence cheaper The memory keyword is required for reference type varialbles: arrays, structs, mapping, strings, etc. . | Pushing to the array: Person Satoshi = Person(172, &quot;Satoshi&quot;); people.push(Satoshi); . | In solidity, all functions are public by default. Good practice is to intially make all the functions private and then only make public the functions you want to expost to the world Convetion to start private functions with underscore (function _generateZombieID()) | Return values function sayHello() public returns (string memory) { } . If a function does not change any values, we can term it as a view function. [function sayHello() public view returns (string memory) {}] Pure functions =&gt; not accessing any data from the contract. . | Keccak256 and typecasting: Ethereum has the hash function keccak 256 built-in, which is a version of SHA3. keccak256 expects a single parameter of type bytes This means we have to “pack” any parameter before calling keccak256 | Compiler supports typecasting var = uint8(var) =&gt; This shit | Events are a way for your contract to communicate to your app front-end that something has happened on the blockchain, which can be listening for certain events and take actions when they happen Example declaration: event IntegersAdded(uint x, uint y, uint result); //Include input and ouputs to a function function add(uint _x, uint _y) public returns (uint) { uint result = _x + _y; emit IntegersAdded(_x, _y, result); return result; } . | .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
