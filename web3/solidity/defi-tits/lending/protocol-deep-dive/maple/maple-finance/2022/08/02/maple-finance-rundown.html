<a class="anchor" href="#brief-overview-maple-finance" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Brief Overview: Maple Finance</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Decentralised corporate credit market protocol.
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Note</strong> This is a decentralised protocol but not trustless, since we always HAVE to assume Pool Delegates to be fair and non-malicious actors</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Borrowers can leverage their reputations to get undercollateralized loans over time. They do so by getting access to capital pools of different Pool Delegates after liaisoning with them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interest Compounds</strong>: Interest is accrued and reinvested to enable capital to compound over time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pool Delegates</strong> carry out the entire due diligence. Lenders chill out. LPs (Lenders) earn revenue by claiming interest generated by the pool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pool Delegates use Maple to attract funds, crack good deals with blue chip borrowers and then earn good performance fee. But they have to stake a good amount of MPL-USDC 50-50 BPTs (Balancer Pool Tokens) so that their incentives are aligned with the LPs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After agreeing on terms with a borrower, one or more Pool Delegates will fund the loan with funds available in their pools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Stakers</strong> are MPL holders and deposit BPT as first loss reserve against loan defaults. BPTs are burned to cover the shortfall after liquiditing the collateral of a borrower.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concept of ideal collateral ratio, grace period, late fee and liquidation post grace period exists.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Governor</strong> is a multi-sig wallet that controls the administrative functions in the protocol (admin)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Contract Instance Admins</strong> or local admins are admins for a particular task. Eg. These admins are set by:
    <ul>
      <li>Governor in case of factories</li>
      <li>Pool Delegate in case of a Pool</li>
      <li>Borrower in case of a loan</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Protocol Admin/Global Admin</strong>: Can call only one function, that pauses every outward facing function of the protocol. Called only when things have got really bad.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="maple-protocol-architecture">
<a class="anchor" href="#maple-protocol-architecture" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Maple Protocol Architecture</h2>

<p>The architecture is pretty straightforward. Doesn’t need much explaining.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is a Pool Factory, which will create Pools, which will be managed by Pool Delegates. Simple.
    <ul>
      <li>Each pool will have a Liquidity Locker (created from its factory) to store the pool’s liquidity</li>
      <li>Each pool will have a Debt Locker (created from its factory) to store the debt that is given out from that particular pool</li>
      <li>Each pool will have a Stake Locker (created from its factory) for the Pool Delegate to stake their MPL-USDC BPT tokens. This is where the stakers would also stake their tokens.</li>
      <li>Each pool will generate some MPL rewards as a result of this staking and will be distributed among the LPs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Similarly there is a Loan factory, which will be used by Borrowers to create Loan requests(contracts). Simple
    <ul>
      <li>Each loan will have a Collateral Locker (created from its factory) to store the borrower’s collateral</li>
      <li>Each loan will have a Funding Locker (created from its factory) <strong>which I am not sure why it exists. Probably to store the repaid amount? IDK</strong>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ofcourse Chainlink oracles are being used to fetch prices and execute functions dependent on price action.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="security-considerations">
<a class="anchor" href="#security-considerations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Security Considerations:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Pool Delegates are supposed to be trusted actors. Can’t really do anything if they turn out to be malicious.</li>
  <li>dapp.tools (HEVM) has been used for extensive unit testing + fuzzing
    <blockquote>
      <p>If you know anything James Bach, you’ll know that he’ll call this checking rather than actual testing. And this is what basically interests us here.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>External code audits by Deduab, PeckShield, TrailOfBits, Code4rena.</li>
  <li>2 week internal audit by the Maple team
    <blockquote>
      <p>This kind of audit is often susceptible to developer biases. But it is complimented by external audits here… So, shouldn’t be much of an issue. Anyway, we are still more interested in testing rather than the auditing and the plethora of audit reports of Maple.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>OZ Defender is in use to inform of any emergencies.</li>
  <li>Incase of a oracle outage, all transactions requesting asset prices will be reverted. Manual override possible.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hmm interesting claim. Will be fun to check this.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Incase of emergencies, <em>contract instance admins (local admins)</em> and/or <em>protocol admins/global admins</em> will come into play.</li>
  <li>Smart contract logic that is deployed on the mainnet cannot be altered in any way. Fuck proxies.
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is good. Significantly reduces the surface area of possible attacks.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="understanding-pools">
<a class="anchor" href="#understanding-pools" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Understanding Pools</h2>

<p>If as a LP or staker you want to withdraw your funds, you’ll first have to trigger a cooldown function and wait for it get over before you can withdraw your funds or even cancel your staking as a staker.</p>

<p>In the following image it is not depicted properly, but the Pool Delegate also has to stake a shit ton of BPTs to be whitelisted as a Pool Delegate by the MapleDAO in the first place.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44272939/108764517-b457fa80-7520-11eb-9f32-73c09c278b92.png" alt="Users that can interact with a pool"></p>

<h2 id="understanding-loans">
<a class="anchor" href="#understanding-loans" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Understanding Loans</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Loan contracts are created by <em>Borrowers</em> out of the <em>LoanFactory</em> contracts, which are whitelisted in <strong>MapleGlobals</strong> to ensure that only certain types of <em>Loan</em> contracts are used in the protocol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Loan contracts are used to:
    <ul>
      <li>Set terms such as:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>APR, Payment Interval Length, Term Lenght, Collateral Ratio, Collateral and Borrow asset, etc.
    + Receiving capital from lenders
    + Withdrawing the loan
    + Interest Payments
    + Liquidating Collaterals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Important point to note is the use of <strong>Payment Calculators</strong>. These are used to calculate interest payments, late fees, premium fees etc. These are also whitelisted in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MapleGlobals</code> to ensure no malicious payment calculators are used.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>At first glance this looks like a whitelisted library which will be used for calculations based on the specifications of the loans, such as simple/compound interest. This also means that no calculation would be happening inside of the Loan contract</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Need to check if these calculation libraries can somehow be tampered with.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>A Loan can be funded by any number of pools, but those pools must be instantiated from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PoolFactory</code> contract itself.
The LPs get LoanFDTs.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>LoanFDTs are similar to LP Tokens as they represent a claim over a part of principal plus any proportional interest that gets generated.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>LoanFDTs that Maple is using isn’t the same old ERC20, they are using a relatively unknown ERC2222 standard. Need to check that thoroughly then.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>Borrowers can drawdown any amount that is both above the request Loan amount, and below the current balance of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FundingLocker</code>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The question here is, why would Maple allow lenders to deposit funds in the Loan contract past their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requested</code> amount? Wouldn’t that essentially be wasted amount?</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>At the time of the drawdown:
    <ul>
      <li>a percentage of the drawdown amount is paid to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MapleTreasury</code> from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FundingLocker</code> as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">treasury fee</code>.</li>
      <li>investor fee is paid to the lenders (a % of the drawdown amount). Sent from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FundingLocker</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Loan</code> to be claimed by the lenders.
        <blockquote>
          <p>Seems a bit off. Investigate again.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>Drawdown minus fee is transferred to the Borrower</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excess funds are sent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Loan</code> contract to be claimed by the lenders.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Normally, interest is paid in constant amounts at regular intervals, and principal is returned on last repayment. Otherwise, you can also pay the entire remaining balance of the loan in one transaction including principal and the amount the interest that should be paid (we use a function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PremiumCalc</code> here).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Liquidations work as usual apart from the fact that you can only call it as a pool delegate if your equity in the loan is more than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minLoanEquity</code>
</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>This again will be interesting to test. Should already be heavily testsed.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>Another (unnatural) thing that Maple is doing in the Liquidation is that, post the calling of liquidation, they are taking the collateral from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CollateralLocker</code> and converting it into the Borrow Asset using Uniswap and then transferring it to be to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Loan</code> contract for being claimed by the lenders.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t understand why didn’t Maple just let the lenders claim their share of the collateral in terms of collateral asset itself. Perhaps it has got to do something with the LoanFDT which is an ERC2222 instead of pure ERC20. Need to get more clarity here.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="understanding-mpl-token">
<a class="anchor" href="#understanding-mpl-token" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Understanding MPL Token</h2>

<ol>
  <li>MPL token is the native token of Maple Protocol and it inherits:
    <ul>
      <li>
<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20">ERC20</a> for standard token behavior</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2222">ERC2222</a> for profit distribution of USDC from the Maple Treasury</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interestingly, the MPL token repo has only been audited by Peckshield. So, this token particularly must have stringent testing.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, what’s more interesting is that the scope of Peckshield’s audit is just <em>ERC20-compliance of the Maple token</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, everyone already knows what ERC20 is, so let’s skip it. But what’s interesting…is the use of ERC2222 standard, which adds the functionality to represent claims on any type of crypto cash flow on top of ERC20 functionalities. Think of it like this standard enables dividend like payouts in crypto where token holders are treated akin to share holders and all withdrawals which is based on the proportion of the withdrawing party’s MPL holdings is taken care of, by ERC2222.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>MPL token is used in the 50-50 MPL-USDC Balancer pool created during the protocol deployment and will be used in all other Balancer pools which will have BPTs used in StakeLockers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The MPL token recieves fee periodically from the Treasury (at the discretion of the Governor).
    <blockquote>
      <p>Basically funds are gathered in the Maple Treasury from all kinds of protocol fee, converted to USDC and sent to the MPL token contract.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>When MPL tokens are added as liquidity to the Balancer Pool, the Balancer pool is the owner of those tokens, which are accruing USDC interest (from the Maple treasury, read point 3). To account for this, the FDT (MPL token contract) has an additional function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">withdrawFundsOnBehalf</code> which allows for the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Claims USDC interest from MPL contract, transferring it into the Balancer pool contract address</li>
      <li>The USDC supply increases and the MPL supply stays constant, increasing the implied value of MPL (since the buy pressure on MPL has increased)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did the buy pressure on MPL increase when the quantity of USDC increased in the MPL-USDC 50-50 balancer pool?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, because according to the constraints of the pool the quantity of both MPL and USDC must remain equal (50-50), and when the quantity of USDC is increased in the pool, the traders are incentivized to take out the excess USDC by supplying MPL. And to supply this MPL, they’ll have to buy it from some DEX/CEX.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simple Concept.
    <ul>
      <li>Lender funds need to be protected in case of a loan default</li>
      <li>This protection(cover) is provided by volunteers. How can they do this?</li>
      <li>Well, first they have to add liquidity to the MPL-USDC 50-50 Balancer Pool and get Balancer Pool Tokens (BPTs). Users can also directly buy these tokens.</li>
      <li>Now every pool has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stakeLocker</code> where these users can stake their BPT tokens and get StakeLockerFDTs in return.</li>
      <li>Users use these StakeLockerFDTs to claim all future interest, since Pools reward the StakeLockers with a portion of the revenue generated in compensation for assuming more risk.</li>
      <li>And at the time of liquidation, if these tokens are enough to compensate the lenders for the difference between the collateral required and pending repayments, then these users get the remaining BPTs, else, tata, bye bye.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The actual calculation of the minimum amount needed to compensate the lenders is a bit complicated (atleast looks complicated), since it requires you to be a little familiar with the Balancer protocol too.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Need to study, understand and potentially test this calculation.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#understanding-lockers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Understanding Lockers</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Dedicated smart contracts to hold custody assets. They’re kinda paranoid. I like this.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Ok, no they are not paranoid. It’ll be holding assets only in the v1. In later version it is supposed to all sorts of weird things.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Lockers and what they hold:
    <ul>
      <li>LiquidityLocker: asset used for liquidity for funding Loans</li>
      <li>DebtLocker: Holds custody of LoanFDTs (to claim revenue and make liquidation calls)</li>
      <li>StakeLocker: BPTs (used as a reserve to cover losses from defaulted Loans)</li>
      <li>FundingLocker: Asset that will be borrowed during the funding period (pre-drawdown)</li>
      <li>CollateralLocker: Collateral (against any loan)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In order for any new Locker strategy to be implemented, its corresponding Factory must be whitelisted in MapleGlobals using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setValidSubFactory</code>
</li>
</ol>

<a class="anchor" href="#understanding-oracles" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Understanding Oracles</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Chainlink oracles are used as price feeds.</li>
  <li>An oracle wrapper contract acts as a safeguard against oracle downtime.
    <blockquote>
      <p>I think a better solution would have been to have two oracle integrations (both Chainlink and Uni) so that if one fails, we always have the second one to fall back on.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>and yeah, even after those two, we could have had a oracle wrapper contract as a safeguard against orale downtime.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>For USDC prices, a constant USD oracle will be deployed, with a constant price of 1 * 10 ** 8. 
Note that USDC has 6 decimals only but Chainlink price feeds use 8 decimals of precision</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>Planning for a zombie apocalype:
    <ul>
      <li>Oracle wrappers have the capability to provide a manual price in the event of an oracle outage, using the security multisig. In all other cases, it will simply pass through the value from getLatestPrice in the Chainlink oracle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="functioning-of-extendedfdts">
<a class="anchor" href="#functioning-of-extendedfdts" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Functioning of ExtendedFDTs</h3>

<p>These FDTs are extending the functionality of FDT to include functionality to account for <strong>losses that must also be distributed</strong> for liquidity providers and staker.</p>

<p>For Pools, it happens in the case when a loan has defaulted, all the BPTs are burnt and still there is a deficit.</p>

<p>For Stakers(StakeLocker), it happens in the case when a loan has defaulted and any number of BPTs are burnt.</p>

<p>Formulae used for accounting for losses are the exact same as normal FDTs. Check them out.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#handling-custodial-ownership-using-erc2258" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Handling custodial ownership using ERC2258</h2>

<p>Another awesome ERC that Maple brings to light is the ERC2258, which allows tokens to be custodied by an entity such that they cannot be transferred/redeemed for underlying liquidity, yet allow the rightful owner to retain all future benefits and all losses.</p>

<p>Example:
It allows users to stake PoolFDTs in the MplRewards contract without changing their PoolFDT ERC-20 balance. This allows them to earn MPL rewards in the MplRewards contract, while simultaneously accruing interest earned by the Pool. This would not have been possible with the original SNX-fork of the liquidity mining contract, since in that implementation, all Pool interest would have been accrued to the MplRewards contract itself, since it would hold a balance of PoolFDTs</p>

<p>This of it like pledging your stonks to someone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Need to test this a bit.. can we transfer funds after giving custody and so on…</p>
