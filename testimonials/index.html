  <p>One of the best audit experience we have been a part of. Rahul (and Parth) were great to work with. Their attention to details on contract design and adversarial thinking helped us along the audit process. They have delivered a well structured and comprehensive audit report.</p>

  <p>I went and sought out three general code reviews. Rahul’s was the highest quality I received! 25+ action items and not a single one was fluff or padding.</p>

  <p>I had the pleasure of working with Rahul Saxena, a highly skilled Blockchain developer who helped me bring my platform to life. Rahul’s in-depth knowledge and expertise in Blockchain technology was instrumental in designing and building my platform.</p>

<p>Throughout the development process, Rahul demonstrated patience, dedication, and professionalism. He was always available to answer my questions and provided clear explanations, making the entire process seamless and stress-free.</p>

<p>I was particularly impressed with Rahul’s attention to detail and ability to customize solutions to fit my unique needs. He went above and beyond my expectations to ensure that my platform was functional, secure, and user-friendly.</p>

<p>Working with Rahul was a fantastic experience, and I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a reliable and experienced Blockchain developer. Thank you, Rahul, for your exceptional work and dedication to my project.</p>

  <p>You will come across only a few as diligent and “Ridiculously efficient” engineers as Rahul. I had the pleasure of working alongside Rahul as a blockchain engineer at Sublime. During the past year, I have watched him constantly strive to optimize and revamp our codebase, be it smart contracts or testing frameworks. His attention to detail has helped eliminate multiple vulnerabilities from our protocol. He has always been the go-to person for exploring new ideas and his Make-It-Happen attitude is a bonus. He is usually the first person to help out or collaborate with other team members. He will be a great value addition to any team he joins.</p>

  <p>Detailed report. It’s really great to have a second set of eyes look through the code and to make sure all the bugs are patched. No one could have done it better than Rahul. Excellent writeup and a detailed review. It was precise and I learned a lot.</p>
